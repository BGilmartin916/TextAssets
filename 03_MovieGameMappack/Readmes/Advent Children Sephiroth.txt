******************************READ THIS BEFORE PLAYING***************************************

Installation:
	
	Place Advent Children Sephiroth.pk3 into the "JKA/GameData/base" folder.


Multiplayer- To activate cheats, you do thing a little different. Activate the console by hitting shift+tild(~). Next type /devmapall "mapname". Example: /devmapall mp/duel1. The map will load with cheats activated. Open the console again and type /npc spawn "npc's name". Example: /npc spawn ac_sephiroth_szico... Notice that single player you have to put the "/" slash before the command.

Here are the npc model names for this pack (With a brief description)...
	
	Here are the npc model names for this model...

		"ac_sephiroth_szico"

	Note: you must enter one of the above names when spawning your npc. 	

	cont... close the console by hitting the tild (~) again.

NOTE:
==================================================
You can bind a key to spawn an NPC if you wish, this will save you having to type out the same command everytime you want another Sephiroth.
This is done by opening the console and typing bind "key you want to press to spawn" npc spawn ac_sephiroth_szico.

For example, if you wanted to spawn a sephiroth when you press the 'M' key, you would type: bind m npc spawn ac_sephiroth_szico
Then press enter to confirm the command. If you want to kill all the NPC's you have spawned, you should type npc kill all into the console.


What has changed since The Midgar v2 version?
1) Bot Support
2) Team Skins.
3) Fixed textures
4) No confliction with Midgar pk3 or any old AC weapon mods.
5) Both the bot and the npc will use the masamune weapon.
6) If you DO have either of the above two mods, you may find you have 2 masamune weapons in your list, don't worry, they're both the same :)

Team Colors: Yes
Bot Support: Yes (Although taking on the NPC is much more challenging!)
NPC Support: Yes 
New Sounds: No (Combination of laziness/the fact that Sephiroth never actually speaks and I prefer not knowing)

***Trouble shoot***

Usually there are only a few errors make that cause problems. Here are the most common...	
1) Not using the proper console commands for "Single Player" or "Multiplayer"... cheats are acivated differently for each. Read "Instructions" up above.
2) Having the pk3 placed in the wrong folder.
3) Make sure you have the latest Jedi Knight Academy update (v1.01), Not having the update will cap out your NPC files.

Special Thanks to: 
		Grievous|SR for pushing me to get this done (Although you went completely the wrong way about it ...)
		Minilogoguy/Mars Marshall and Inyri Forge for the .bot file help.
		Darkharn for rearanging the pk3 and generally doing all the boring bits I couldn't lol :)
		Antizac (For the original model/skin)

If you like this I suggest you take a look at Almighty_Gir's upcoming 'FF7' style Sephiroth :D
Oh, and I 'borrowed'*cough* Mars Marshall's Grievous readme because it's so darn good and edited it. Hope you don't mind :)
