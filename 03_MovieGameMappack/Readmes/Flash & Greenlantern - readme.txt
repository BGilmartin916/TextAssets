GREEN LANTERN 2.0!

Changes: I pretty much started again from scratch. I added texture to it. I also changed to look more like Hal Jordan. I added bot and single player support too.

Install: Multiplayer- Extract the greenlantern.pk3 file to your GameData/base folder.
         Single Player- Extract the SPgreenlantern.pk3 file to your GameData/base folder. Also make sure the greenlantern.pk3 file is also in the GameData/base folder.

Description: Skin based on Hal Jordan from the Green Lantern comic books.

Comments: A special thanks to DC Comics for publishing such a great superhero.
