Comments : 
Well this model was made by Darth Kitty and released with his Solid Skake Pack as a hidden character.  As such, it had no sounds so i added some :).  I also fixed up a few of the skins and added a few of my own, such as the bloody one that is missing an arm and the blue team skin.  I also made it selectable in single player mode, but it is not fully customisable, each icon represents one full skin.  Hopefully i will be able to add full sp support some time soon.  I am also working on a pseudo Mr X (Olga in the Ninja suit from MGS2) for all the gals that wanna use this model both in MP and SP.  I will also be ading new icons (the icon with the Real gray fox in the background and the model in the foreground is the new one) so that it is easier to figure out which model is which.
Also, there are npcs packed in there and you need the Hattori Honzo sword for them or else he will have just a plain saber.

Here are the npcs P by their name means they are player friendly and E means enemy:
Gray_Fox_Melee (Melee Fox but doesn't do much)P
Gray_Fox (Regular Gray Fox)P
Gray_Fox_mgdmg (a damaged Gray Fox that is missing an arm and has a bloody eye)P
Raiden(ya gotta have the Dante reskin of Raiden)P
Gray_Fox_mask (i think this is the one with the mask closed)P
Gray_FoxE (Regular fox)E
RaidenE (Regular Raiden)E
TheBride (The Bride from kill bill ((get the model at the lucasfiles.com))P

All credit for the model and most of the skins goes to Darth Kitty.


May you all enjoy this awsome model by Darth Kitty and the awsome SP support by me! (well mabey it is not AWSOME but it is still cool.)
