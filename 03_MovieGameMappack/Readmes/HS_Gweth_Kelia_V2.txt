Gwethenea Description: Originally a character for my short stories and what-not when I was in a professional writing and editing course at University, Gwethenea quickly became a personality I role-played with on various rpg’s my brother and friends had corrupted me into liking. 

Now a character on various RPG servers in JK:A, here’s her final look.


A customizable menu female model with many options and a total of approximately 27648 possible variations.

This model is made in such a way that it can resemble a smuggler, pilot, trader, rogue, agent, spy, formal/royalty virtually most character concepts.

*Other*
Many parts of this model are constructed by HapSlash. Some may be similar to parts from his other models but many have been tweaked a little if not completely retextured.
Some parts of the model, although re-skinned and re-shaded are from the previous Gwethenea re-skin by Elvarg/Scerendo.
Previous Gwethenea skin was a re-skin of SaberGirl’s sabergirlleela_version.zip
Elvarg: elvarg@msn.com
Sabergirl: sabrgirl@online.no
Some small parts are also from Raven’s Jan and hf-jedi.
I think everyone will notice the short hair, holster belts, and sleeve ends from the Leela model.. only rewoked some here.  Jaden and Jan bits here and there. with a portion of my ESB Leia.
As Kelia Leenat and Gwethenea V2 were planned to be a joint release, this is a continuation from that original plan anyway.

Head Icons: Gweth
All Other Icons: HapSlash

*Fixes*

Fixed vertex’ and vertex shading errors which existed on both Gwethenea and Selene/Kelia parts. 
Worked a little more on the weighting, there is now weighting/animation to the mouth for SP cut-scenes.
Bottom of the nose where textures were slightly blurred has been fixed.
Re-aligned parts that were slightly off in previous version.
And much, much more.

*Bugs*

Some minor little texture bugs, nothing too big, a little clipping in texture hardly spotable, but mostly with the coats, hence why you choose no holsters when wearing the coats= no clipping(so not really an error, d’uh).

-----------------------------------------------------------------


* How to install *

**You -MUST- delete any previous version of Gwethenea and Kelia for this to work properly** (errors can occur, and maybe not occur, so be on the safe side with clearing out the V1’s) Place the pk3 in your base folder and enjoy. Or if you have the JA+ mod, it can be placed in the japlus folder.
