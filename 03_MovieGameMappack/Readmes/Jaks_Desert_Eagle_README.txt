Description *
*********************************************************************************************

For my Next addition we have the Desert Eagle .50 cal pistol, this pistol is know for its use in movies such as the Matrix' standard issue pistol for "Agents". The Desert Eagle was developed by "Magnum Research Inc." and comes in a vaiety of calibers ranging from the .357mag, .44mag and the whopping .50 cal not to be confused with the 50 bmg which is a large rifle round, the .50 cal pistol round is just slightly larger in scale than the .44 mag which is a huge pistol round as it is. Before people start making remarks that it is scaled too large in the game I must warn you that the actual pistol measures nearly 11" long so yes, this pistol is very large.        

I hope you enjoy this pistol, I have included 2 versions for you to choose from, 1 is the standard Issue Nickel Plated "Agent Smith" version, and the other is a Tactical replica based on real world tactical accessories that are available for this pistol.

I pride myself of trying to keep as close to real world weapons as I can, but nobody is perfect, so please no complaints, if you dont like it, simply use something else, however constructive comments are welcome, as long as they are constuctive and mature. So please PM, Email or in some other adult manner contact me in this reguard. However, publicly bashing mod authors for whatever reason serves no purpose except to make them not want to make more models.
