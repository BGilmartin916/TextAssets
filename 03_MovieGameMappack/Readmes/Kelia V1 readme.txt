Words from Kelia:
Hey all, I wanted to take a minute to yabber on. Now not everyone will read this I'm sure but to those that do. Big thanks go's to Hapslash! He's been awesome doing this for me, and the model came out sooo well to ^^ *Hugs*
Now my only terms on use of this model are, if you want to use it on either RPG World or New Era you ask me first. All other servers etc are open field, enjoy the model. Its based off Selene from Underowlrd, incase anyone figured it out!
Oh and also if your going to reskin this model be sure and give Hap his due credit!
Once again thanks Hap for all your hard work and putting up with me, Have fun and May the Force Be with all of you!

Special Thanks from K:

Just something simple put together for a very close friend of mine.

The only truly new mesh piece created for this model was the head, everuthing else should seem familiar.  I think everyone will notice the short hair, holster belts, and sleeve ends from the Leela model.. only rewoked some here.  Jaden and Jan bits here and there. with a portion of my ESB Leia.
