		 Future Releases
:-------------------------------------------:

Future releases of the Movie Game Mappack will be put up
on the installer and will be avaliable to download in
.zip format from my filefront site (http://hosted.filefront.com/Plasma89/).

I'm afraid that is probably it from me this will be my last proper release
apart from all the fixes for this version.

There are a few more maps in the work though and I'm sure Frost will release
them eventually.

If you've made your own movie/game map and want to include it with the pack
get in contact and I'll put it in with the next release as long as it is not
absolutely terrible.
