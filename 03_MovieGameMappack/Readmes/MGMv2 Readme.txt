		  Description
:-------------------------------------------:

For awhile now I've been working on some movie
maps that take advatage of B19's new FA features
I'm finally pleased to realease these maps as
I've been sitting on some of them for awhile.

:-------------------------------------------:
		Maps V1
:-------------------------------------------:

:--Aliens 2--:

Aliens was a big success in the first release
but one of the big problems was that humans
could camp in various places and instant win
because they had time. In this version humans
have to complete and objective and will lose 
on time if they do not. The FA on this one
is also themed more around the second Aliens
movie.

          FA: Alpha, Plasma, Azuvector

	  Sounds: Vi
	  Models: Jora Custov, Lervish, Fox(c)

:--COD4 Tanker--:

This map is taken from Orbitius's Raid 3 FFA
map (With permission) and is tied in to the
first SAS level of COD4 where the SAS get onto
the tanker and take the data from the terrorists.
In this one it has changed a little though as 
rather than the data being in the holds it is 
now in the bridge.

:--Halo Fall of Reach--:

Thanks to Immenor for giving me the moontooth map
to use I was able to bring this together at the last minute.
Please note this map does use ported models from Halo but 
before you cry foul Microsoft recentely put up a page on their
website saying they allow it and also let their characters be
used in other games such as Unreal Tournament 3.

:--Helms Deep--:

The actual map was finished in time for the last
release however I never did get round to making the
FA eventually after passing it round to a few people
it finally got done.

          FA: Plasma, Alpha, Davegrohl
          Models: tylerkilbourne
	  Skins: KOTORMRJay, Ender_920


:--Jurassic Park Site B--:

Loosley based on the second film where they run
to the abandoned facility to radio for help. Big
thanks to Lervish for animating the TRex and 
Pterodactly and Some0ne was weighting the Raptor
as a player model, the map would be rubbish without
them.

:--MK Deadpool--:

Ace asked me to do this I think or somebody did
so anyway I did it and added it to the pack.

	  Textures: Plasma
	  Skins: Charlie "Silent" Nguyen

:--TMNT--:

Szico gave me permission to bring his Neotokyo
into MB2 awhile back and I did it up for the CMP
under Coruscant Undercity. Now I've added a Turtle
FA to it so it can also be used as that.

Credits - Map: Szico VII
	  Textures: Szico VII
	  Models: Shady-D, Lightsource

:--WW2 Omaha--:

Another map that Orbitius let me use, I had to make
it much smaller though due to the 5 minute time limit.
Just a disclaimer so Mace doesn't get mad :P it is
not supposed to be ultra realistic nor is it supposed
to be exactly like the D-Day landings on Omaha.

:--300 Thermopylae--:

After being bugged continually
by Ben and Lerv for a 300 map I finally decided
to make one :P

This one is supposed to be the battle of 
Thermopylae where the 300 strong spartans face
off against the strong near infinite numbers
of Persians.

Credits - Map: Plasma
	  FA: Plasma
	  Textures: Plasma
	  Models: Lervish, Ben, Kevin Coyle

:--Aliens--:

Hmm this one wasn't really supposed to represent
scenes in the actual movies and the map was actually
supposed to be one of my first maps for the CMP.
While looking through my folders for older maps I
spotted it and decided to do it up a bit and
release it as a proper map.

Credits - Map: Plasma, Frost
          FA: Alpha, Plasma, Frost

	  Skins: RJK Jack O'Neil(Ki_Adi),
	  Sounds: Vi
	  Models: Jora Custov, Lervish, Fox(c)

:--De Dust2--:

Darth.Hunter was kind enough to let me make an
alternate FA for his mb2_cmp_dust map, so now
it plays sort of like CS.

Credits - Map: Darth.Hunter
	  FA: Plasma
	  Skins: RJK Jack O'Neil(Ki_Adi)

:--FFVII Shinra HQ--:

What pack would not be complete without a FFVII map
:P. Luckily for me Szico already made one of the 
best versions of a Final Fantasy map already and 
after letting me use it I converted this over to
MBII. 

Doing a true reperesentation of this part of
the game would have been kind of impossible because
I don't have all the models avaliable, instead I made
the objective to get to the roof where the fight with
Rufus would have taken place in the game.

:--Matrix Burly Brawl--:

Acidus's awesome Burly Brawl map, great fun.

Credits - Map: Acidus
	  FA: Plasma
	  Textures: Plasma
	  Models: Jora, JEDI_Salvation, TMU team

:--Matrix Lobby--:

Ah the map that started it all, after finding out
that Acidus was making Burly Brawl I decided to go
to my next favourite matrix scene the lobby
shootout.

:--MGS1 Ninja--:

Two of the coolest characters evar in one boss
fight awesomeness.

This is the boss battle between the cyborg ninja
and solid snake.

Credits - Map: Plasma
	  FA: Plasma
	  Textures: Plasma
          Models: Graves, Darth Kitty, Revan Dark

:--MGS1 Ocelot--:

This is actually my first released map ever
although I must admit I've made it a bit better
now adding trip wires for C4, sound effects,
better lighting, better textures etc.

I find this map very nostalgic (If you play
the MGS series you'll get that if you didn't
get it and you do play MGS I suggest you play
through 2 again so much so you can recite
everyones lines).

	  Skins: Tyrael

:--MGS2 AGear--:

After playing through MGS2 for the first time
I have always thought that this scene would make
an awesome co-op map and well now here it is.

Shame I couldn't get anything better for Tengu 
models but meh what are you gonna do :/

Credits - Map: Plasma
	  FA: Plasma
	  Textures: Plasma
	  Models: Graves, IFailedEnglish, Lervish
	  Skins: Scerendo

:--MGS2 Fortune--:

This one was pretty logical to do seeing as it
is a part of the arsenal gear map, all I had to
do was split it up and make a new FA. One of the
cool things about this one is that you never
got to play this boss battle out in the game but
now you can.

	  Textures: Plasma
	  Models: Graves, Hapslash

:--SM3 Venom--:

I was bored so I decided to map this one quickly
mainly because it uses textures that I've already
made and the other reason is that I noticed I was
tending to make more game maps than movie maps :P

	  FA: Plasma
	  Textures: Plasma, necros
	  Models: Alex Brown
	  Skins: Elandain, phonock

:--SSB Pokemon Stadium--:

No this is not a pokemon map, it is actually based
on one of the stages that is featured in Super
Smash Bros. Melee and the soon to be out (Well February
anyway ..) Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

FA consists of normal Nintendo characters.

:-------------------------------------------:
		Installation
:-------------------------------------------:

Put the PK3s in your MBII folder.

OPTIONAL: Install zzz_matrix_low_shader if you
are experiencing FPS problems due to the reflective
floor, this new shader should clear that up, although
it won't look as nice QQ

:-------------------------------------------:
		    Bugs
:-------------------------------------------:

Lots but I can't remember them all, post them
as you find them and I'll get them fixed for the
next release that I plan.

		Special Thanks

DG for testing and their general awesomeness.
