Description: This is my attempt at creating Mitsurugi from Soul Calibur using the samurai model.  I think it turned out pretty good despite some of the model's drawbacks.  There are a lot of parts on this model that have not been welded together so you can see between some of parts and I had a few issues with uvmapping that makes texturing a little tough but overall the experience was good.  I still think it's worth taking a look at.  You be the judge.

Credit: I have included the Readme file to the original samurai v2 model as requested by the JKfiles administrator.  I have also utilized some of the original artwork from Soul Calibur 3 to complete the skin and use as a reference.  Below are the names of the original Samurai v2 artists as stated in the readme file.

***Trouble shoot***

Usually there are only a few errors make that cause problems. Here are the most common...	
1) Not using the proper console commands for "Single Player" or "Multiplayer"... cheats are acivated differently for each. Read "Instructions" up above.
2) Having the pk3 placed in the wrong folder.
3) Make sure you have the latest Jedi Knight Academy update, this is very important!
4) sometimes the model will not show up in the select menu, The Game loads them in reversed alphabetical order, so Yoda should show up in the top. If not you may just have too many models. You can rename the pk.3 to Z_something, and this will put it at the top.
