feet as her weapons.

*original saber:
 It contains "hand_tifa" saber, which seems no-weapon although actually 
pounch-attack. If you press [Ctrl+Alt] at the same time, she shows
VERY strong action that seems not from her slim arms.

SOUNDS:
Sounds are mainly from the movie "FF7 Advent children" and others are from
free WAVE resourses. The very idea of using sounds from the movie has been
hit by LSD2Rayden. After listening his sounds, I re-extract&encode totally
by myself from the movie. Now all the necessary resources are set!

BUGS: Sometimes legs seems to be odd because it is the combination of two 
different parts of the model.

=========================================================================
Very big thanks to Dan Kapphahn 'DAK/Antizac' for making such an great model.

Beta tested by me and LSD2Rayden.
