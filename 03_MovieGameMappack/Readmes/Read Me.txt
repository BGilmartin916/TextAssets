Why???:  I made this orginal for a clan mate who wanted a neo experance, and well it turned out that are server will not alow it untill it is much liked so it is common for other people to have it, hint hint :P. Ok, well the name explanes it all, it is a pipe made to look like the one Neo used in the matrix. I hope you like but I mostly recommand it for RPG play.
