Props:
Huge thanks to Gir for making this project 1000x easier by allowing me to rig and mess with his Kadaj model. I have to say I've learned a lot as a result of working with him and hope we get a chance to do it in the future. Special thanks to Ryojin for doing the selection dirty work, as I can't be bothered with that silliness, and fortunately he's cool enough to do it for me.  :)

Props to: Inyri Forge for shader help, Noen Garuth, Jalechah, Anakin992, Kyoku Maggot, and Ryo Thorn for moral support and crits. 

Has it been a year already since I started doing this stuff? Seems a lot longer than that. Its been fun...just wait and see what I've got cooked up for next year...  :)
