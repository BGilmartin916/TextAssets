Hi ppl
Im constantly trying to make a skin for myself that I can more or less identify myself with :)
Theese skins I am very happy to release, cause I feel its some of my better work.
Im always going for Black when I make skins for myself, this is because I like that color
very mutch :)

This skin has been converted from JK2 to JK/JA (no bones changes) and now works perfectly 
in JA without respawning of textures when you die (has been a problem with JK2 files put into JA)

To uninstall, just delete the sabergirl.pk3 file from the base directory.

Credits:
Thx to one of the great model makers Dan Kapphahn (DAK, a.k.a Antizac)
I got his permission to do this :)
I just love theese skins.


If you are gonna modify/reskin this skins, pls contact the original creator of the model Leela
and me.

have fun :)
