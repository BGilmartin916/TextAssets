        CREDITS: Antizac (original model), Super Smash Bros. Brawl (sounds)

        INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Place the pk3 in your Gamedata/base folder.

        DESCRIPTION: The King of Evil, Ganondorf himself, comes to Jedi Academy! Special thanks go to Cosplay.net, where several Ganondorf fans were able to get a clear shot of his cloak embroidery. There's a wee bit of texture distortion on the thighs thanks to the deformation of the model, and the hair is obviously slightly inaccurate, but IMHO the longer hair looks better anyway.

        BUGS: None other than model-restricted clipping.
