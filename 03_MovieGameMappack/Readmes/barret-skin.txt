File Name	        : \Barret Wallace.zip

Description		: This is a reskin of Matt-Liell's Punisher model, to make Barret Wallace of Final Fantasy 7 lore. Yeah, the model may be too skinny for the Barret in the FF7 game, but for the Barret from the movie, it does it's job. :P. I tried my best to make a decent barret skin and i think i did alright. THe red skin version (aka the AC movie Barret) may not look as good as the default skin, but meh. The blue skin version has an outfit i thought of myself. Basically a mix and match of the default and red version, with some colour tweaks. For all the skins i used shaders to improve the skins. Like metallic shin for robotic hands, arms and torso, and so on.  
			
Installation	 	: Place the pk3 in your base folder.

Known Bugs 		: The are visible gaps between the head and shoulders, hands and arms of the model. But these are bugs in the model, not the skin.

Credits			: Thanks to Matt-Liell for his Punisher model.
			  Thanks to Squaresoft for making the Final Fantasy series.
