CREDITS: These go to Hapslash for his amazing model, Gwenethea and Kelia for their awesome Textures.
BuffytheSlayer for her support and contribution of the NPC files and Bot files for the skin as well as the awesome screenshot and adding Buffy's fists as weapons and some minor fixing.
Inyri Forge for some tips :).

Please Note that I tried to get permission from the authors but never got a reply and also Kelia's email returned as an error, Gwen never answered and Hap's inbox was full. But I am crediting all
of them so if they have any complains about this I will be happy to oblige to their demands. This is not my model, it's theirs.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Just put into your Base folder.

DESCRIPTION: This is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I made her because there wasn't a skin or model of her for JA, only a skin for JO that wasn't very good.
I tried to make her face look the most as Sarah Michelle Gellar using pics of her and this was the closest I could get.

Note that this is V1, there will be a V2 and I promise to make it better than this one.

It has four outfits, two with jacket, and one with a top and one with a shirt.

Also I added SP support so now Two heads are selectable, five different torsos, and 2 pants.

Enjoy
