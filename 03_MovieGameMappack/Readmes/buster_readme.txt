CREDITS
--------
Most of the crediting here should go to Almighty Gir, for providing me with a great reference shot from FF7 and for suggesting the project, even though I hate FF7. Really, though, the Buster Sword is a classic, even if you *do* hate the game.

Also credits to ElegosVos for the great screenshots! You have an eye for style, my man!

of course thanks go to Square.

DESCRIPTION
------------
This is a model of the *FF7* Buster Sword used by Cloud. It is *not* a representation of the Kingdom Hearts Buster Sword or the Advent Children Buster Sword. It is modeled after the buster sword seen in the game Final Fantasy 7, with a bit of my own detailing.

----------------------
SPAWN INFORMATION
----------------------

To use Cloud's Buster Sword in SP, use the following command:

saber buster

BUGS
-----
No real bugs to speak of, that I'm aware of.

COMMENTS
---------
Please don't complain that "that doesn't look like the buster sword from AC!" I already explained why it doesn't. I'm sure I'll still get complaints of that nature from people too lazy to read the read-me or the file name... *sigh*
