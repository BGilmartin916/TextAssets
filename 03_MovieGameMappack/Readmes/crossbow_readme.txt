INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
Put crossbow_if.pk3 in your base folder (located in your Jedi Academy directory).

------------
DESCRIPTION
------------
It's a crossbow. It should have most, if not all, of the appropriate parts, as I tried to make it as accurate as possible. It also actually fires bolts (for the uninformed, these are like arrows... except bulkier). This replaces the blaster rifle.

-----
BUGS
-----
For single-play, I have included an altered weapons.dat to slow down the firing rate, to make it more believable. However this won't affect MP, so you're going to have a *very* fast crossbow. Also, the blaster stance looks silly from certain angles, since there's no handle on this crossbow. Try to ignore that if you care.

---------
COMMENTS
---------
I've had this model done for months, and I got to the point where I decided I didn't want to waste it. So enjoy, if it's your kind of thing!
