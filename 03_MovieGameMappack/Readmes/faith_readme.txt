FILENAME: Faith.pk3
FILESIZE: 11.9 MB 
DATE RELEASED: June 1, 2010


CREDITS: Hapslash (original model, some textures), Facepunch (feedback and reference), EA Games (character design)


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Place Faith.pk3 in your Gamedata/base folder.


DESCRIPTION: This is a skin of Faith from the hit game Mirror's Edge. 

BUGS: None that I know of.


COMMENTS: I've been sitting on this project for a long time until I figured out how to crack the Mirror's Edge file format to listen to the sounds for the voice samples. I've seen a few other people try to make their own versions of this character, but I wanted to make sure I got everything as accurate as I possibly could without an entirely new model. Enjoy, all you Runners!
