FILENAME: Lara.pk3
FILESIZE: 4 mb
DATE RELEASED: 7 june 2007

CREDITS: I would say Raven for the model, but it's not the best thing around so nah.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Put the pk3 file in you gamedata\base folder.

DESCRIPTION: Since I did't find many female skins or models around I thought of making a skin myself, I have changed the face of jan so she looks more like Lara, the file has three default skins, Lara with the old green top, a black dressed Lara with army pants and the scuba Lara from the movie (with a cool shader), also all the sounds are new, including three taunts, I hope you all like her, I believe she looks realy cute.

BUGS: I have tried the shader with JKA and JKA+ mod and both worked fine.

COMMENTS:Two of the screens are wallpapers.
