Special Thanks to:	Everyone at the Jedi Knight II forums,  for all their help, support and feedback. And everyone at the Zelda TC forums 
		(http://s8.invisionfree.com/Zelda_JA_TC) for encouraging me to do such an extensive overhaul on Link
			And you, for downloading this - Now, don't you feel special? =)

==========================================================================
NOTES:

Known bugs:

nothing that stands out too much, except for a few clipping issues, with the arms and the sheath...
..maybe a few barely unnoticeable odd deformations...that might be it.

Link is gonna have to be right-handed, as he's always been in JO/JA. It's hard-coded, and built into the animations that way.
There's nothing I can do. Deal with it.

==========================================================================
HISTORY: 

Version 1.0
A re-shape, slight modeling, re-weighting and re-skin of the Jedi Trainer model in Jedi Outcast, led to the start of Link's appearance in Jedi Outcast...

Version 2.0:
A few things have been added and changed. The Link's sword sheath is now included on the model (also removeable) - the strap across the torso, 
and the belt are more detailed (modeled buckles, and such...). Link's face has some slight modeling tweaks, but not very noticeable - the eyebrows on the 
face have been adjusted, (not to mention the wonderful eye-fix by {DX}Obiwan) I think it looks much better. Other than that, I think it's just about perfect, now.
(comment: What the hell was I thinking, back then?)

Version 3.0:
Re-modelled the hair and re-shaped the nose, somewhat - he looks more like Link, now. Added more detail to the gauntlets, and adjusted the boots, a bit.
Added the "sheath" version (with CTF skins, of course).
(comment: seriously, I should go back in time and kick my ass)
Special Bonus skin in Version 3.0: 
The Fierce Deity. Additional meshes were added to make this skin possible. Textures re-created by me, spending hours in Photoshop, glancing back and forth from 
screen to Majora's Mask player's guide, for reference. If you don't like the Fierce Deity, atleast appreciate, my greatest skinning job to date. =) 
(comment: It wasn't a bad skinnig job -but now it's better)

Version 3.JA:
Fully supported for JA (to the best of my abilities) Even works 100% with Dual blades...
-All skins work correctly, in JA, as well as the sounds.
-Swords included in zip as seperate PK3s, and work as selectable hilts with JA. 
-Bots use their respective hilts as well...
(Comment: did not have JA's Character Customization support)

Version 4.0:
-I originally started re-doing Link, back in late 2004... Simple tweaks, and later in spring 2005, I added the "Twilight Princess" gauntlets...
-Late Fall 2005, I started remodelling, skinning and re-UV mapping Link, and adding things for a fairly decent "Twilight Princess Link" model
-Basically fixed most of the clipping issues, due to re-modelling, almost everything.
-Added FULL JA Support - Character Customization support with color palettes. Previous version "Link 100%JA", it was not. 
-Added "Open Jedi Project" holster tags. The sword and shield should holster themselves perfectly with any mod that uses this function - considering the sword is saber_1 and shield is saber_2 
(Lightsabers or any other swords/weapons might look odd)
This model is now, officially 100% JA compatable.

Included, with this version, as a bonus - is "Young Link", from "Ocarina of Time"/"Majora's Mask" (I tried making him look like a cross between the two)
He also has OJP tags, but he looks friggin' huge, unless you have a mod, that allows "Playermodel Scaling" in which I suggest he be at a scale of 65.
But most mods limit scaling - so probably 70 - 75, would look fine.
I included an NPC file for "Young Link" - so you can atleast see him at the scale he's supposed to be at.
I also planned on having Character Customization support, for "Young Link" but I ran out of time. If any one wants to make a patch for this function (ONLY A PATCH) 
then please do. He just needs the "head_x1, torso_x1 and lower_x1 .skins, and the corresponding icons - the shader's all set up to work, properly.

==========================================================================
MISC NOTES:
I seriously doubt any more skins for Link, are even necessary, but your welcome to try and convince me otherwise.
...If you want to slap your damn clan logo, on Link - Don't submit it to any sites. Keep it to your clan.

Bring back this mod, right here:

Original story, set not too long after "Ocarina of Time"...Awesome, awesome mod. I loved what they were doing.

* Copyright / Permissions *
This model, and the textures that came with it are not to be modified
in any way without the permision of it's creators.

I don't work for Nintendo, nor do I have any contact with Nintendo - I am an 
independant modeller, (who wanted to see Link kick ass in Jedi Outcast/Academy) acting on my own behalf.
I have also not made any money or profit from the creation of this model - infact, I believe, I have lost money, 
and many hours of my life, that I can't get back, because I spent so many hours making this model.
