Description: "To the one called Maw: a bitter individual that loathes all and holds loyalty to few. A strong and formidable foe. For every cord of muscle, there is hatred. 
It is this hate that keeps his aging body strong," said Qu Rahn's force ghost to Kyle Katarn. In the beginning of Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight, the player sees a cutscene with
Qu Rahn on board Jerec's ship, Vengeance. As most of you know, Qu Rahn takes Yun's lightsaber and cut off Maw's legs before he is defeated by Jerec. I've attempted to make
a model of Maw before he was cut in half, with a few changes to add more detail to the skin.

Bugs: Clipping with flap, I doubt I'll ever get the flap weighing down. Facial weighing is funny as well.

Comments: I hope you enjoy this! Please feel free to use the model for reskins or whatever, tis but a raven edit, just give credit where credit is due.

Special THANKS to: Lucasarts, taunt is from JK1 cutscene.
