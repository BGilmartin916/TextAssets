CREDITS
--------
There are lots of people I should credit, and most of my supporters know who they are. Top credit, of course, goes to BioWare for creating this wonderful IP that I love to death. I wouldn't be the same without you, and Mass Effect is such a wonderful game series.

Second credit, which is a very close second at that, is to minilogoguy18 who did an ABSOLUTELY fabulous job rigging this model. Give him 50% of the props, because any model, no matter how well built or painted, is going to look terrible if it doesn't deform well. He worked magic on a very complex mesh and took my sometimes unreasonable demands to heart and has produced a model that could have deformed like limp spaghetti and turned it into something wonderful. If I had rigged it myself you'd have gotten limp spaghetti for sure.

Third, I need to credit the people who contributed skins! I appreciate all three of you - Veilor, Cloud Senatu, and Ruxith - and want to thank you for contributing to the release. All seven skins included from these three authors are fantastic!

Lastly, and there are too many people to name, but thanks to everyone who followed the progress, gave me feedback and motivation to continue, and to all of you who will download this and enjoy it. Modders will want to check out the Distribution Notes section for some special instructions on what I will and will not allow in terms of remodding this geth.

DESCRIPTION
------------
We are geth.

This model is a completely custom made replica of the geth trooper from the Mass Effect series. It is particularly modeled off of the geth engineer variant found most easily in the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer game. All content is completely custom. This means the mesh was 100% made from scratch, the textures were fully painted by hand by myself with no photosourcing at all, and even the soundset is completely custom made with no sounds sourced directly from the game.

This model took me about two weeks to sculpt, two weeks to paint, and two weeks to do all the retexturing and packaging for Jedi Academy. I began work on July 31st and am officially calling it done today, on September 12th. This is the most challenging, most rewarding, and most successful project I have completed to date. I'm very happy with the results and I'm hoping the Mass Effect fans out there -- and maybe even some folks who aren't into Mass Effect -- will enjoy playing with this model as much as I've enjoyed creating it.

There are seventeen (yes, you read that right) skins included with this package. Ten of them are made by me, one is made by Veilor, one is made by Cloud Senatu, and five are made by Ruxith. Skins mimicking real Mass Effect NPC's are as follows (some are loosely based on their in-game counterparts in cases where a new mesh would be required):

-geth trooper
-geth rocket trooper (ME3)
-geth prime (red team skin)
-geth hunter (ME3)
-geth pyro (loose interpretation)
-geth destroyer (Veilor's skin)
-Legion (pre-gaping hole)

----------------------
SPAWN INFORMATION
----------------------

Bot support is included for all Mass Effect NPC skins listed above. Bots can be spawned through the normal in-game interface.

NPC's for these skins are also available. They can be spawned with the following commands:

npc spawn:

geth
geth-hunter
geth-pyro
geth-rocket
geth-prime
geth-destroyer
geth-legion

BUGS
-----
Minilogoguy18 did a fabulous job with the rigging, but due to the way I have built the model some minor clipping with some of the tubes is unavoidable during certain animations. Clipping is incredibly well minimized, but you will notice some. We felt that the minimal clipping that exists is preferable over some more extreme solutions that would have either resulted in increased polycount or weird deformations.

I have also been unable to spawn the NPC's in single-player without receiving the "ran out of transform space" error, although one of my beta testers had absolutely no problems whatsoever. We both sport 8gigs of RAM, so if they work for you more power to you, but since I can't even get them working properly I can't make any single-player promises. I can tell you I have tested out single-player species customization and THAT works fine, so that may be a feature in a future release if the demand exists.

COMMENTS
---------
A few things I want to include in this section.

First of all, this model is fairly high poly for a game this old. During testing several testers experienced some very significant FPS loss - myself included - when spawning multiple geth. Nobody reported any crashes in multiplayer, but having five geth on screen took my FPS from 90 to 30. This is going to be unavoidable at close range. There are plans to add a future version with LOD's (which hopefully won't fall through) so once that happens it should mitigate some of the performance loss when geth models are at a greater distance.

I'd also like to take this moment to mention that the geth is segmented to achieve two things:
1) If you like dismemberment, the geth comes apart at all the right places and has caps. Chop him up.
2) All meshes are fewer than 500 polies, meaning dynamic shadows are supported (if that's your thing).

DISTRIBUTION NOTES
-------------------
If you want to remod this model, this is the section you want to read. Read it very closely so you understand what I will allow you to release and what I won't.

I have included a photoshop PSD file in the release archive for those that would like to reskin this geth and would like to make use of the original tools I used to make the different colorations. This consists of several adjustment layers. If you're not sure how to use them please feel free to ask on any forum I frequent, or e-mail me.

NOTE: When releasing a mod of this model you MUST INCLUDED THIS READ-ME IN YOUR PACKAGE. You also MUST include a link to where you found the original file so that others may download it. If you do not do these things you do not have permission to release your modification. You do NOT need my express permission to release a modification of this file (although I'd certainly like to see what you've done).

YOU MAY:
-release recolors of this geth using the included PSD file as long as recolors retain the original base texture
-repackage the original sounds with your reskin
-release a clan reskin as long as includes a significant change (it MUST be more than adding a clan logo)

YOU MAY NOT:
-rerelease any unaltered portion of this package except for the basic files (like the glm - this means if you haven't changed it and it's not needed for basic function, remove it from the package)
-release any reskin that does not retain the original textures UNLESS you repaint the model entirely from scratch (repaint means you must make a reasonable attempt to retexture this model by hand)
-release any modification to this file that is obscene, contains illegal content, or is in poor taste
-release a reskin that includes adding only a logo to the original texture

If you have ANY doubt about whether or not your alteration falls into the mays or may nots please e-mail me and I'll let you know what I think. My objective is not to stifle your creativity - just to protect my own.
