CREDITS
--------
Thank you to BioWare for all the inspiration you've provided me (and making some pretty cool games with some pretty cool weapons in them).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
Place either the "me3-widow.pk3" or the "me3-black-widow.pk3" in your ...Jedi Academy\GameData\base folder. YOU MAY ONLY USE ONE OF THESE FILES AT A TIME. To uninstall, delete or remove this file.

------------
DESCRIPTION
------------
This gun is a custom replica of the M-98 Widow Anti-Material Rifle first introduced in Mass Effect two. Two versions are available - the standard Widow and the Black Widow. There is no difference between these two guns beyond the look. The weapon features custom sounds, strings, firing and projectile effects, and icons.

These two files both overwrite the same gun, so obviously you can only use one at a time. Please select the skin you would like (view the screenshots to see the difference) and place that file in your base folder. You can keep the other file in a subfolder if you want to switch back and forth at some time in the future.

-----
BUGS
-----
In third person view the gun will frequently fire two projectiles. This is probably the way it always was, but becomes very obvious with the new effects. I have no been able to determine why this is (it doesn't appear to happy as much [or at all] in first person).

---------
COMMENTS
---------
The mesh of this weapon is not perfect. Mass Effect 3 has given me the ability to get much better references, however this model was completely finished in 2010 before Mass Effect 3 was released, so some areas are not 100% accurate. At this time I do not plan to remodel it to increase mesh accuracy. Future weapons will be truer to their in-game counterparts.
