Description		: This is a reskin of the Cultist model to look like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat.

Comments		: It's my first skin so go easy on meh. :D  I've included Blue and Red versions . Sorry No bot support yet.  (I have yet to learn how to do so).  The reason why I created this was because I am a long time fan of mortal kombat but the reborn skins of the characters were not my taste.  The hood through me off.  When I got jka, I saw that a cultist model would be a good model to skin on. SO here you have it. Yes, you can consider the blue one to subzero and the red one to be ermac but they all have the "GET OVER HERE!" taunt so, if that ruins your game, im sorry. The only thing about this one is the neck brace looking thing. I don't like it.

Bugs                    : The shoulders textures dont line up, only cause of my inexperience to skinning.

Credits                 : Raliegh for using some sounds in his Mortal Kombat Skin Pack.
