Model description       : This pack includes four different types
of raptor dinosaur--scaled NPCs using modified skins and HP levels.
It is fully animated, with all-new sounds from the film Jurassic
Park (suprised?).  It's very ferocious and stuff.  It also includes
a "Raptor Red" skin from the famous novel.  NPC and vehicle names
are as follows:

Velociraptor: velociraptor
Deinonych: deinonychus
Utahraptor: utahraptor
Megaraptor: megaraptor
Raptor Red: raptor_red
Utahraptor Vehicle: raptor_v

Other info              : It's possible we will release an updated
version in the future.  If you have any ideas for things to add,
don't hesitate to post them in the comments section (please do not
email me with them).  Also, please don't complain about the size of
the velociraptor.  That's how big they were.  For maximum enjoyment,
please download a really gory blood mod for use with this one.

Additional Credits to   : Ryan North, Brian Lozier, Robert Bakker,
James Guerney, Tito (for finding the raptor measurements), Jurassic
Island for reference images, the population of Massassi.net, and
the small group of LucasForums denizens who don't suck arse.
