Description : Rayman , who doesn't love him ?
I recently dug out my copy of Rayman 3 and this motivated me to try to recreate Rayman for Jedi Academy
As you might notice this model is heavily based at his appeareance in Rayman 3 , teamskins being the red and blue 
powersuits from that game , I tried to recreate him as accurate as possible and I think it turned out pretty good 
but I'll stop boring you with my blabla here time to show you the features :
Rayman comes with :
-Team support
-Bot support
-NPC support - for all 3 available skins

BUGS : some usual clipping issues but nothing to bad

INSTALL : put  the Pk3 in your base folder 
UNINSTAL : remove the Pk3 from your base folder
