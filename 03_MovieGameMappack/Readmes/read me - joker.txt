FILENAME: lsjoker.pk3, jokerhud.pk3, jokerhudplusfix.pk3
FILESIZE: 13.4 mb
DATE RELEASED: 09/2/2008


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Put the two pk3 files in you gamedata\base folder and the jokerhudplusfix.pk3 in the JKA plus folder ( in case you want to use this pack with JKAplus, the directory usually is this "D:\LucasArts\Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy\GameData\japlus")...if you want to get rid of the hud and screen modifications delete the jokerhud.pk3 and the jokerhudplusfix.pk3.

DESCRIPTION: This a model/skin pack of the arch nemesis of batman from the new "The Dark Knight" movie. The release includes different features to use... the model comes with npc and bot support, there's a new weapon used by the npcs, full sound set ( some of  the sounds used only by the npc ) and customizable single player options.
The last part of this pack ( the second and third pk3 ) has a new joker themed HUD as well as some modifications of the game screens. The file jokerhudfix.pk3 lets you use the hud with JKA+ and changes other screens too.

BUGS: As far as I know the hud works fine with the default game and the JKA+ mod, I haven't tested with other mods. As for the model the only thing I could find it's some clipping through the body... I suppose due to my still growing skill with the rig.

COMMENTS: This model was created having the Heath Ledger version of joker in mind so all the model variants are taken directly from the movie.

If you want to change the model through the console the commands are the following:

model lsjoker
model lsjoker/red
model lsjoker/blue
model lsjoker/goon

If you want to spawn the Joker Npc: 
-npc spawn lsjoker ( default joker )
-npc spawn lsjoker2 ( red version)
npc spawn lsjoker3 ( blue version)
npc spawn lsjoker4 ( masked version)


CREDITs: thanks very much to Yodaman123 who recorded really good sounds for this pack. Also thanks to "The one and only" who gave a last moment advice on fixing the HUD.

LAST COMMENTS: I would prefer if this minimod and model/skins remain untouched so if you want to modify o change something in this please contact me first.
