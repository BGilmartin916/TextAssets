File Name		: neo.pk3
File Size		: 2.14 mb
Date Released		: 7/26/03

Installation            : Throw *.pk3 file into JO base folder (as if you didn't know that...duh)

Description		: 3 Different ReSkins (using something other than the reborn model) with completely new textures and the prisoner model. Includes Bot Support as well as New Sounds taken straight from The Matrix. If somebody else made public Neo skin and is offended by my attempts, I apologize, I spent about 3 months looking for one then gave up and decided to make my own so here it is, enjoy! Thanks to everybody at Massassi forums for being so hard on me :D and everybody at jediknightii's forums for their support :D  **Default = Neo without holster and trenchcoat (subway scene I guess...whatever, I thought he looked cool and since I don't have time to learn to model, live wthout the trenchcoat and sunglasses...sorry :P) : Red = Real World Neo with plug on back of head: Blue = Thomas Anderson **From the beta I fixed some major texture problems, he looks more like Keanu now instead of a "sick japaneese michael jackson" also I added some new sounds and changed the bot file a little.

Comments		: Distribute freely. No known bugs

***This is my third attempt at creating skins so tell me what you think. Feedback is feedback.***
