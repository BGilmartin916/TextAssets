    First of all I'd like to thank    Marchus Williams (a.k.a RED SITH)    for letting me use his saber menu mod.

 Inside the  "extra choice"  folder :

 " BB_MENUS_4.pk3 " :This is a menu script that binds all the list of weapons & players from this mod and my other mods.
                                   The mods included are, "Ifrit (2.0)" , "Shiva" , and this "Knight and War Tauntaun".

 *****   Weapon List  *****

   Entry names and descriptions for the weapons:

   sw          :(single saber) knight sword. 
   sh           :(dual)  knight shield. shield has better defense against attacks. in SP menu, only appears on the left hand dual.  
   mace       :(single) knight mace.
   lance       :(single) knight lance. with a new ability to "charge", for details read below.
   ban_b      :(staff)   knight's banner! _b means it's blue colored. with "charge" ability. for details read below.
   ban_r       :(staff)   red knight banner. with "charge" ability. for details read below.
    
   ban2_b     :(single) blue knight banner that's attached to wrist. works as shiled. in SP menu, only appears on the left hand dual.  
   ban2_r      :(single) red colored wrist banner.
   gsw          :(single) knight's great sword. it is a single-style weapon but set as "two handed", so you can't equip it as dual.
                               and it will appear in the "staff" saber menu.  
                               
      Ok here is the "below",
      Special "charge" ability for the selected knight weapons is basically the force leap animation added as taunt. 
      So whenever you use taunt on the weapon. You will do a force leap without slow-motion or Matrix camera angle.
      Also, the special attack for those weapons is changed to a stab, not that stab down stab but a horizontal stab.
      You can move around and change direction while stabbing, to aim effectively at your opponent and extent the attack range.   
      Try do taunt "charge" ability first and use this stab, it's a powerful combo attack. Bind a key to easily activate taunt :) 
      The combo key order should be:  TAUNT, then MOUSE R + MOUSE L      (or what ever you set the keys to)

      If you don't know how to bind taunt to a key:
      In a single player game, hit "SHIFT" and "~" key to open up console, type in "helpusobi 1" and hit ENTER to activate cheats.
      Pick a key you want to use as taunt, if it's "f", then type in "bind f taunt", hit ENTER, and hit "SHIFT" and "~" to exit console.
