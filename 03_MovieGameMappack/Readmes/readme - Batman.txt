CREDITS: As always thanks to all the people in the forums with they tips, critics and support... especially Jose Carlos who has helped with some pats of the rig.
Thanks to Mad Cat MkII for taking the time to record some of the sounds in the pack.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Unzip the "batman_pack.pk3" and place it in the base folder of the game.

DESCRIPTION: Well after all the hype of the new The Dark Knight movie I thought it was right to at last finish my pack of one of the coolest comic characters out there. This is a pack containing one Batman model with five skins... they are the default model of Batman Begins with his red/blue team of the classic Batman and Batman beyond and two more extra skins... Batman the dark Knight and Tim Burton's Batman.
The model/skins come with new sounds, single player support and bot/npc support... so I hope you all enjoy playing around with it as much as I making this.

If you want to spawn npc the commands are these...

npc spawn batman1: Batman begins
npc spawn batman2: Batman returns
npc spawn batman3: Batman dark knight
npc spawn batman4: Batman beyond
npc spawn batman5: Batman classic


BUGS / COMMENTS: Not much to say here... there's some clipping with the capes and in some parts of the model... all of that thanks to the shape of the model and the crappy JKA skeleton.

If you are thinking in re-skinning or modify something of this pack please as me for permission.
