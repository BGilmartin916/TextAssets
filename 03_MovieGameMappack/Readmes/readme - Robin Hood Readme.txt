INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Put robin_hood_rs.pk3 in your base folder. Delete the same file to uninstall it.

DESCRIPTION: This is a reskin of the reborn model from JK2 meant to look like Robin Hood. It doesn't exactly resemble any traditional Robin Hood image, it's more like a guy with a green shirt and hood. I used Errol Flynn as a reference for the face, so if you think it looks familiar, that's why. It comes with all the bells and whistles--bot and npc support, SP support, and team skins. w00t!

PERMISSIONS: If anyone would like to use this skin in their own mod, please ask for permission first. Chances are I'll say yes. :P

Thanks to the people on the Filefront forums who gave me suggestions and helped me improve what I had done. Muchas gracias!
