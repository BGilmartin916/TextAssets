File Name: averagejoe.pk3 and averagejoe_bots.pk3
File Size: 1.3MB
Date Released: 30 January 2005

Credits: Credits go to LucasArts, Bioware (I borrowed some textures... but thoroughly tweaked them!), and Google... where would I be without Google? :P

Installation Instructions: Put in your gamedata/base folder, as usual.

Description: The main skin was originally for a mod I was making, but I don't think it's ever going to be released so I'm just releasing the skin as-is. This is basically just a normal guy - his outfit consists of jeans, a sweatshirt, and let's not forget some brand-name sneakers (with the brand name removed... of course :P). In addition to the main skin there's a second joke-ish skin. When I finished it it gave me the impression of a suburbanite out mowing his lawn... Have a good laugh with it ;)

NPC Instructions: This skin has both friendly NPCs and enemy NPCs. The friendly NPCs have the same amount of health as the Kyle NPC does, so rest assured they won't die right away. To spawn an NPC in singleplayer, bring down your console and first type "helpusobi 1" to enable cheats, then type "npc spawn" with the appropriate name. The two NPC names are listed below.

Friendly NPC:
averagejoe_ally
averagejoe_summer_ally

Enemy NPC:
averagejoe
averagejoe_summer

Known Bugs/Issues:
I haven't found any... and I actually tested the skins thoroughly this time so there shouldn't be any missing extremities or untextured areas.

Comments: Ha, I finally added teamskins. Unfortunately my list of male contacts has been dwindling so no custom sounds. It's not using Jaden or Kyle sounds, so that at least should be a bonus.

For those of you that have so many bots you don't know what to do with them all I added the bots in a separate PK3, so if you don't want them or don't have room for them you are not forced to have them :)
