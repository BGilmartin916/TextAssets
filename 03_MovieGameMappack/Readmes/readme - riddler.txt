Brief Rundown
---
This is a Batman: The Animated Series rogues skin pack.

The Joker's red skin is supposed to resemble The Joker from the 60s Batman series.
The blue skin is based on his appearance from The New Batman Adventures.
The default skin is based on the look from from the first 90s animated series.

Two-face's red skin is just a totally scarred over version I whipped up in a short
amount of time. The blue skin is Harvey Dent (duh). The default skin is.. well..
Two-face. This skin has a few inaccuracies that stand out, but that is mainly due
to limitations of the model (Agent Smith).

The Riddler's red skin is a simple color change. The green has been changed to hurt
your eyes. The blue skin is based on his look from the 60s Batman series. The 
default skin is based on his look from the first 90s animated series.
