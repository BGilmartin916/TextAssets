   improvements to the original "Wonder Woman" skin:
   1) Wonder Woman's front was enhanced.
   2) White stripes (missing on the old skin) were added to Wonder Woman's boots.
   3) Saturated colors were fixed.
   4) Missing sounds were fixed and new sounds were added.
   5) The icons were changed (and fixed so they will display for the bots).
