CREDITS
--------
Credits extended toward BioWare for their creation of the Mass Effect series, and also to everyone who provided helpful assistance in the creation of this weapon.

--------------------------
INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
Dump this is your gamedata/base directory within your Jedi Academy directory.

------------
DESCRIPTION
------------
This is one of the specialized pistols to replace your default in Mass Effect 2: the Carnifex Hand Cannon. It will replace the blaster pistol and has appropriate strings, effects, and sounds.

There are two files here - an ME2 version and an ME3 version. These guns are IDENTICAL except for the sounds, since ME2 and ME3 have drastically different firing sounds. Use only ONE of these two files. I don't know what happens if you use both. The world might explode.

---------
CHANGELOG
---------

A new Mass Effect 3 version has been added with sounds from ME3.

-----
BUGS
-----
None that I'm aware of.

---------
COMMENTS
---------
There is no normal mapping in Jedi Academy. Makes me a sad panda. :(
