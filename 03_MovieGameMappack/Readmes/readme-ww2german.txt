Unzip the mohgerman001.zip file into your "base" folder in the JK2 gamedata folder. To uninstall, simply delete the extracted mohgerman001.pk3

If you start your game and find your German Officer skin not visible in the character selection menu, you probably have a ton of skins as I do. To select your MOH skin, bring down the console with SHIFT + ~ (tilde) and type 
/model gofficer

Or, for team colors:

/model gofficer/red
/model gofficer/blue
