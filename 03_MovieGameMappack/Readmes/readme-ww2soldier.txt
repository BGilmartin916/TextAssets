File Name		: WW2-Solider.pk3
File Size		: 470 kb
Date Released		: 6/20/02
Installation            : Throw *.pk3 file into JO base folder (as if you didn't know that)

Description		: I Got kinda bored one day and was watching Saving Pvt. Ryan so i figured why not make some ww2 skins(since i got a lot of grief about my first skin...the overused reborn model).  All the textures with the exception of the hands are either brand new (taken off of shots from the movie and highly edited) or retouched.  The only thing that is different between skin colors is the helmet, I did this to reduce file size.  I did the best i could with the Bespin Guard model to show pockets and straps, granted if I had 3d studio max I'd have done a better job with it.  Have fun, play hard, and enjoy =O)

Comments		: Distribute freely; Default = Captain : Red = Medic : Blue = Mesh-helmet 

***This is my second attempt at creating skins so tell me what you think but go easy on me.***
