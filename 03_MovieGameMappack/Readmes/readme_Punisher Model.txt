Thanks to:              A Big, HUGE, MEGA Thanks to LightNinja who put it ingame and 
                        Scoutrooper for skinning the head
                        
Changes:                Team Support has been added with a red and blue skin. Default
                        skin has been touched up.
                        A new bonus skin was added which is my favourite to play with.:)
                        Sounds have been changed from the defualt ones.

Notes:                  The first pack (punisher.pk3) must be in your base folder with
                        the pun_generic.pk3 for the bonus skin to work properly.

                        I made this update because seriously whats a model without team                          
                        support, but I had the hardest time trying to think of what I                           
                        could do for them, so here is version 2. The model has great                             
                        skinning opportunities so if you want to skin him, please feel                           
                        free, but BE SURE this readme goes with it.
