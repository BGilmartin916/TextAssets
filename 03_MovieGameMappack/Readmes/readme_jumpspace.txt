Addition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tested this map on a clear version of JKA (v1.0.1, without bonus mappack).
So if there are still some unexpected bugs then you have broken shaders
or assets in your base folder. If you are sure that this is not the case 
contact me personally or in the forums i mentioned above. But i hope that 
won't be necessary ;P

The archive 'jumpspace.pk3' includes the following files:

	- map in .bsp AND .map format
	- new textures
	- new shaders
	- new effects
	- arena file/levelshot/botroute

...and the folders that belong to them.

To map with my shaders enter "jumpspace" into your shaderlist.txt!
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY ANY MATERIAL OUT OF THE .map,I SEND IT FOR 
LEARNING AIMS ONLY!!!
