DESCRIPTION: Raid3 FFA began as a the third installment of the imperial raid siege trilogy.. but we decided, since the previous siege maps barely got played, we'd make it an ffa/team mod. Here's the laundry list of features in this mod. 

MAP: A large scale "oceanscape" featuring a large detailed cargo ship, an oil rig, a military air base installation, and a military base w/ a fully functional missle silo. 

VEHICLES: 2 unique and fully functional comanche helicopters, a harrier jet, and a speedboat.

WEAPONS: Glock G17, M3 Super 90 Shotgun, M16A2, M82 Barrett, SMAW, MP5k, M67 Grenade, Colt Anaconda. Also, HUD icons have been replaced. 

KNOWN BUGS: Vehicles will fly slightly underwater before blowing up; When launching the missle, make sure you aim and hit the buttons straight on forward or it may misfire or not fire at all.
