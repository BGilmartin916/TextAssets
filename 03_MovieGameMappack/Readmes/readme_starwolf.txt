INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: Place this pk3 into your gamedata/base folder.

DESCRIPTION: This is a reskin of Shady-D's interesting Werewolf model. Inspired by Star Wolf from Star Fox: Assault, this skin uses Wolf's taunts and sounds from Star Fox 64. Since the head texture was mirrored, it was kind of difficult to do the eyepatch's band, so I settled for tapering it off so it supposedly disappears into the fur. So, this is sort of a hybrid of the two Star Wolfs. Assault's outfit with 64's sounds. Ho-hum. Anyway, here you all go, Star Wolf fans. 

BUGS: None that I know of.
