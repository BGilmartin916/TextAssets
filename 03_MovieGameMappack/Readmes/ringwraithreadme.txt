Author			: Tim "The Geek" Underbakke
E-Mail			: timothy@underbakke.com
Website			: under construction (A possible new clan--Men of Gondor)

File Name		: Ringwraith2.zip
File Size		: about 880 kb
Date Released		: 9/22/02

Description		: Since I hated my first ringwraith attempt, I built this new attempt.  It uses the new Emperor model that was just released.
			  This file will conflict with my first one.  Delete my first one as it is crap (except for the sounds)

			  New textures, ctf/cty support, and new bots.

Comments		: The hands need work, but otherwise, a good representation of the ringwraiths from LOTR.
			  HIGHLY recommended if you are playing agaisnt someone using the Strider skin.

			  In team colors, the ringwraiths have a icon colored to match their team on their neck area.
			  It is the Nazgul symbol according to the LOTR Trading Card Game.

Install			: Same old, drop in the base dir. routine
