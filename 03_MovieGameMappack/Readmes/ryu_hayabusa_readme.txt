Description:
The main character of the game (ninja gaiden). A descendant of
the Dragon Lineage (hence the stupid thing on his forehead), he
is a young member of the Hayabusa Ninja Clan. His father, the 
head of the clan, has left the village to train the mountains
and has entrusted Ryu with the Dragon Sword, an ancient sword
that has been passed down trough generations of clan leaders.
The Legendary Ninja from Ninja Gaiden. First appeared on the
SNES and than found its way to skip a few generations to the
X-Box.
btw reason i didnt and prolly wont do a dragon sword is cuz
its bassicaly a katana with a red hilt.. The face is quite
accurate but in-game it looks messed up :( Dont believe me?
