Description: Well here's the new version of the samurai, and I can tell you it is much better.
The skins have been refined, sounds are included, and now there are 5 different models.
There's the Samurai, Ashigaru, Kensai, Warrior and the Ronin. Enjoy!

PS: If you get sick of the flag on the Samurai and Ashigaru skins, just open the ashigaru or samurai
.skin file with notepad, scroll down to where it says "banner" and replace "models/players/samurai/flag.jpg"
with "*off". So it should look like this:

banner,*off

Okay, this model was made with the intention to let people reskin it to their heart's content, specifically for clans, just don't use it in your mod unless I say you can. Enjoy!
