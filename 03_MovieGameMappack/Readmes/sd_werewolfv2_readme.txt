Description: Well.... Its a werewolf... :) hunched legs huge claws.
In case u dont know what a werewolf is (could be :P) read on :).
A werewolf is a (wo)man who turns into a wolf when he see's a full moon.
He pretty much goes beserk from that point. So a werewolf is basically
a wolfman ^^ .........

Thats the old description, and it still stands.. Cept for this time its a complete new model from scratch, unfortunatly
the werewolf didnt fit the jka skeleton nicely and i had to murder the model to make him fit.. His legs are completely messed up now
i missed an edge there but im too lazy to fix that..
There are probably some other bugs in there but.. yeah.. Enjoy?
