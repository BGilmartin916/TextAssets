Slenderman Model for Jedi Academy

Author: Mars Ultor

Description:
This is a reskinned Chiss/Bartender model to be Slenderman from the popular Indie Horror game "Slender".
npc support: no
bot support: no
new textures: light grey stone texture for the face and hands
New Sounds: yes, Slenderman is completely silent except for the taunt. The taunt is the dreaded bass end of the piano that the player hears when Slender appears on their screen in the "Slender" game, followed by the static sound. Basically it's what you hear when Slenderman gets you in "Slender".

Installation:
Place Slenderman.pk3 into the gamedata/base foler. To uninstall, simply remove it from the base foler

Permission:
Authors may use this skin for their mods, but please give credit where credit is due.

Credits:

Mark J. Hadly and Parsec Production for the conception and design of Slenderman. Also for the sound that is used for the taunt.

Renix - the tuxdo texture that I used for Slenderman came from Renix's James Bond Model for Jedi Outcast found here: http://jediknight3.filefront.com/file/James_Bond;2221

For those interested, the map in the screenshot is called Haunted Graveyard (beta) and can be found here: http://jkhub.org/files/file/1409-haunted-graveyard-beta/
