Jedi Outcast Name: Malice


Author Notes:
=============

While I am not the biggest Star Wars fan in the world (love the old films but I'm disappointed
with the new ones), I must admit that I relish the work of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Multi-Player
on Jedi Outcast is an awesome experience, but what game is complete without a thick accented
Austrian running around muttering "I'll be back!"?  Out of all Arnold's violent, blood-spewing
characters [Conan is my favorite], The TERMINATOR felt the most appropriate for this game.

This file contains The TERMINATOR, model T-800.  A cyborg from the future, the T-800 appears
to be human, but he is actually a metal endoskeleton covered with living breathing tissue (grown
specifically for cyborgs.)

The TERMINATOR has full bot support, taunt and team support.  And if you don't like cursing,
make sure The TERMINATOR isn't Force Gripped for too long... he gets really pissed off.
(Cover your ears kids!!!)



Special Thanks:
===============

To James Cameron (for creating the awesome Terminator franchise), Lucasarts, Raven, ID,
Massassi.net, Jediknightii.net, jedi-outcast.com and my cuz BuckBonzai for introducing me to
this game in the first place.



Install Instructions:
=====================

Open terminator.zip and extract glm_terminator.pk3 to your "\GameData\base" folder in whatever
main folder you have JK2 installed. The new character should be available from the skin selection
menu the next time you run Jedi Outcast.



Removal Instructions:

Simply delete the glm_terminator.pk3 from the "\gamedata\base" folder in whatever
main folder you have JK2 installed.
