DESCRIPTION: 
4 giant humanoid turtles wearing bandana's and a belt. What else is new?
Our childhood heroes (Atleast, Lightsource's and mine). The four mutated turtles that learned ninjitsu from a giant
mutated rat! Withouth further ado, The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!
This also contains their respected martial arts weapons; Katana, Bo staff, Nunchaku's and Sai's. All of them
created by LightSource. I helped with the Nunchaku a bit.

BUGS: 
clipping

COMMENTS: 
It has some clipping with the shell, i just can't help that.
I really want to thank LightSource for his texture that kind of inspired me to finish this project.
withouth him this would still be somewhere on my harddrive rotting away.

If you wish to edit and redistribute this in anyway,
please contact me for my permission.
If you edit the texture, please contact LightSource!
