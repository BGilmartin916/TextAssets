DESCRIPTION, INSTALL, KNOWN ISSUES: 

Wow...its been a while, and these things have been sitting on my computer for years now. I'm sure the JK3 community is all but dead at this point, and many will probably hate me for having not released these at a time when people actually cared, so I guess it's a good thing that I care little. So here you have it, Neo, Morpheus, and the Katana, all done for the TMU mod that has been dead now as predicted by many. If you need to be reminded how to install, throw them in the Jedi Academy base folder and i think thats it. It should be noted that these are unfinished with the exception of the katana. The player models have no sound, have shading problems, and I think may not even have team color support (it was a long time ago). So if you want to fix that, go for it, credit where appropriate. Have fun guys.
