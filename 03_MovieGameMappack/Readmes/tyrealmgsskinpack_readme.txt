Description             : 

Well, it's finally out. I've been working on this danged pack for about half a year now, off and on. Snake's face gave me a TON of trouble. 

In any case, this is a comprehensive Metal Gear Solid 1 character pack, of all the major characters from that game: Solid Snake, Meryl Silverburgh, Revolver Ocelot, Vulcan Raven, Cyborg Ninja, Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Otacon, and Liquid Snake. Snake, Meryl and Ninja all have their "secret game-completion" costumes, too (Tuxedo Snake, Sneaking Suit Meryl, and Red Ninja). Furthermore, a few people on Hapslash's Void noted that they liked it when I plopped my textures onto Graves' Solid Snake v2, so I've included that in the pack as well, to let people sort out which Snake they like best.


The full list of thank-yous is above, but I'd especially like to give a shout out to almighty_gir. Though he was extremely harsh, he did convince me to texture one of my other projects from scratch, which in turn gave me some skills that I could turn around and re-apply to this skinpack.


KNOWN BUGS              : Vulcan Raven's weighting on his biceps is blatantly horrible. Limitations of the model, I'm afraid.
