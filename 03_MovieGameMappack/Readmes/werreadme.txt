Description		: Multiplayer Player model. The Barbarian Character from Diablo II

Comments		: This is the second version of my Diablo 2 Barbarian Multiplayer model for Jedi Knight II. This characters comes from 
			  Blizzard's Action RPG "Diablo II" I take no credit for the concept of the character, only the construction of the model and skin.
			  The swords in the screenshot are from the Lord of the rings weapons pack and are not included with this file.

 			  The Primary changes from the first version are that the
			  model is much more detailed as well as the skin and has much less clipping and tearing. It also features new taunts and team skins, 
			  though I didn't spend much time on the team skins, since I always turn them off with forcemod anyway. Still no LODs though, perhaps
			  sometime in the future

Installation Instructions: simply unzip KC_D2BarbarianV2.pk3 into your JediKnightII/GameData/base folder. If you have JediMod, ForceMod or any other mod
that uses scaling you can add the following line to the tckmodel.cfg file to scale the model to the appropriate size.

			   "krueg"	1.24	0

			   to open tckmodel.cfg go to your mods folder and right click on tckmodel.cfg, then choose 
				"Open With" the choose notepad.
