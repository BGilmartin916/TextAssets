Description: Recently there has been many experimentations of Shadow Trooper reskins on 'The Void'
	     This is another variation I did. I based it off an unfinished project by Sharad Hett.
             I made most of my textures from the exception of the metal plating on the torso and behind the thighs,
             this is from Neomarz1's Magnaguard,I used this to improve the skin in general since I couldn't find anything
	     else that would fit. I would like to thank my friend Selek, for letting me use the shader on his skin for my icons,
             and getting some sound files - cheers for that Sel.

	     As a little bonus this skin will work in Jedi Outcast as well, simply extract the pk3s in the JO_File folder
             to your Jedi Outcast game data base. There Singleplayer replacements in the folders which need to be extracted
             with the other pk3 in the folder, in order for it to work.

             I would recommend if you have a computer which supports dynamicglow and high textures, with minimal lag that you play
             with those settings to experience the full potential of the skin. Other than that enjoy.

            Skin commands - /model st_shadowtrooper
                                   st_shadowtrooper/blue
                                   st_shadowtrooper/red
                                   st_shadowtrooper/green
                                   st_shadowtrooper/default_glow

                           /model JOst_shadowtrooper
                                  JOst_shadowtrooper/blue
                                  JOst_shadowtrooper/red
                                  JOst_shadowtrooper/green
