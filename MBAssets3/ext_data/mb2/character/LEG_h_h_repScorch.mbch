War does funny things to people. Similarly, some people do funny things with war. Six-Two is the Delta's resident wiseacre, regularly dropping a world-weary bon mot into the stew of violence and destruction that serves as the Deltas' steady diet. A competent soldier, and an excellent explosives technician, Six-Two has an overdeveloped sense of irony that could be mistaken for fatalism.  'Scorch' earned his nickname after an ordnance accident that left him and Sergeant Walon Vau without eyebrows for a short time."
