Originally an Empire Youth in Lord Hethrir's Empire Reborn movement, Tavion Axmis displayed signs of Force-sensitivity and was "purified" by the extra-dimensional being Waru. She received training in the use of her Force abilities under Desann, Hethrir's right hand and failed Jedi trainee; during this training, Axmis was selected by Desann to be his personal apprentice, and the two conceived of a scheme to discover the location of the lost Valley of the Jedi."
