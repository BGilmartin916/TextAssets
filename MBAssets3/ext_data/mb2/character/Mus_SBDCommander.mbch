OOM command battle droids were any OOM-series battle droids used by the Trade Federation and Confederacy of Independent Systems for the purposes of transmitting orders from the Central Control Computer to squads of infantry or security battle droids.
B1s were perhaps the most numerous—and expendable—soldiers in galactic history, and, unlike most organic soldiers, they were capable of action in hostile environments like underwater or in space. They were designed to swamp their enemies with sheer numbers."
