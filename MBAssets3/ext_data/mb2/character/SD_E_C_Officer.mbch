The officer was a high class soldier within the Empire's military who provided a commanding presence among the legions of stormtroopers that were deployed to fight the Emperor's enemies. Their leadership roles often inspired the troops in battle and were capable of summoning more troops onto the field. The individuals of this class were divided into numerous special positions and placements. Despite these variations of the officer class, there was two common traits among them: ruthless ambition,[1] and Humanocentrists who fully supported the Emperor's policy of subjugating non-human races."
