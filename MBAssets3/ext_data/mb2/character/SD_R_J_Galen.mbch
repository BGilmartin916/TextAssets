After the death of Marek, Vader endeavored to create a more powerful and obedient version of his fallen disciple, using a cloning facility on the planet Kamino to carry out this agenda. Starkiller was affected by the emotional imprints that he inherited from his template and consequently developed a fixation on Captain Juno Eclipse, a former Imperial officer whom Marek fell in love with. Dismissed by his master as another setback in a long line of failures, the clone fled from Kamino and began traveling across the galaxy to find Eclipse. After Defeating Vader, Galen proved to be a master strategist in addition to being a powerhouse of raw Force Power. Galen discovered early on that he was capable of practicing a unique form of Battle Meditation, one that was on more grand a scale, capable of helping him determine the best course of action for the best long term results. Where as basic Battle Meditation focused more on a single battle, his version of it applied more to strategic decision making which enabled him to reduce casualties and maximize the effectiveness of the Rebellion. Galen was forced to fall for some traps however to keep the Empire guessing but usually the traps were turned back on the Empire."
