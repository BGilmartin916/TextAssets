Atton Rand was a pilot native to the planet Alderaan and one of the Lost Jedi who helped Meetra Surik defeat the Sith Triumvirate. He joined the Galactic Republic military and fought loyally under Revan in the Mandalorian Wars. He defected to Revan's side when the Jedi Knight became the Dark Lord of the Sith. While under Revan, he was put through intense combat training to make him an effective Jedi hunter, assigned the task of capturing Jedi so that Revan and his acolytes could attempt to convert them into loyal Sith. However, when a female Jedi prisoner revealed that he was Force-sensitive and that he would likely be subjected to such treatment himself, he went into hiding on Nar Shaddaa, the moon of the planet Nal Hutta."
