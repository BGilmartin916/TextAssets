Mister Bones, also simply referred to as Bones, was a heavily modified B1-series battle droid with a murderous personality. He was constructed by Temmin Wexley and built from components the boy scavenged from the catacombs beneath Myrra, the capital city of Akiva. Bones served as Temmin's personal bodyguard in addition to being considered his friend and loyal companion. He had a sadistic personality and would sing or hum while attacking and maiming his victims. After Temmin reunited with his mother, Norra Wexley, Temmin joined the nascent New Republic and helped Norra and her team hunt down Imperial war criminals."
