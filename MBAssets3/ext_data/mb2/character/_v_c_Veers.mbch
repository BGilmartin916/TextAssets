General Veers is a stern and polished military man completely loyal to the New Order. Veers commanded the ground forces attached to Lord Vader's elite Imperial Death Squadron. 
When Vader discovered the Alliance base on Hoth, Veers prepared an invasion army to knock out the Rebel shield generator protecting the base. 
To safely observe his troops raiding the echo base, he brought a cloaking device to follow and command them undetected"
