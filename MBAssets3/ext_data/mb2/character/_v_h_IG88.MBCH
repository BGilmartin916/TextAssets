IG-88 was an assassin droid line designed by Holowan Laboratories. The IG-88 line was a derivative of the IG-86 sentinel droids used during the Clone Wars. IG-88 later became one of the galaxy's most infamous bounty hunters. At some point, one of the IG-88s came under the employment of the Zann Consortium criminal organization, apparently owing the second-in-command of the organization a favor."
