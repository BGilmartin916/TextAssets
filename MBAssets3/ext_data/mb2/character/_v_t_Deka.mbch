description	"Droideka

Attributes:
- Shield Projector (3)
- Shield Strength (3)
- Hull Strength (3)
- Firepower (3)

Abilities:
- Quick Deploy
- Shield Discharge

Unlike the spindly battle droids whose humanoid build allows a degree of versatility, Droidekas are designed with one sole function in mind: the complete annihilation of their targets. The bronzen-armored combat automata has a frightening design, insectoid in its mix of curves and sharp angles. Slung at the end of heavy arms are immense twin blasters, which unleash destructive energy at a pounding pace. The destroyer droid can completely envelope itself in a globe of protective energy via its compact deflector shield generators."
