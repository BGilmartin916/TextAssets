New Model: Yes
Bot: Yes
NPC: Yes
Team Support: Yes
Custom Sounds: Yes
Custom Lightsaber: Yes

DESCRIPTION:

A lifelike rendition of the character Ahsoka Tano, Padawan to Anakin Skywalker, from around the time of her departure from the Jedi Order.

FEATURES:
-----------------------------------

AHSOKA AS SINGLE-PLAYER SIDEKICK:

Have Ahsoka assist you on your single-player missions. After loading a level and activating cheat mode, type this in the game's console:

npc spawn ahsoka

A CHATTY BOT:

Ahsoka's multiplayer bot has a true-to-character, chatty personality, and is loaded with new things to say -- directly sourced from and inspired by her character talk and snap-backs from official games and TV show episodes, leading up to the end of The Clone Wars.

NEW DUAL LIGHTSABER COMBINATION:

Ahsoka being a dual lightsaber wielder in the traditional fashion, with a shoto blade, I've included her second lightsaber in the game's lightsaber selection menu. This allows the player to actually use a shoto (shorter bladed lightsaber). I found this makes fighting against duals a little less predictable, and helps to spice things up a bit both visually, and in terms of gameplay.

Console Reference:
Primary: tano
Supporting (Shoto): tano2

INSTALLATION:
-----------------------------------

Simply move the PK3 files into the "base" folder of your game directory.

KNOWN BUGS:
-----------------------------------

Slight clipping with the skirt and limbs in certain movement/poses, unavoidable due to the game's technical design limitations.
