Comments		:
 
Thank you for downloading the Trade Federation Battle Droid for Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. This model comes with a variety of skins:

Infantry	The standard battle droid
Security 	The red-shouldered battle droid
Pilot		The blue-shouldered battle droid
Officer		The yellow headed command droid.
Geonosis	The reddish-pink droid from the AOTC arena

All of these skins have bot support. In addition, the model has red and blue skins for CTF and team games. It also has full sounds. To install the the model, go to your JKII base directory (inside GameData) and paste zbattledroid.pk3 there.

This model is for multiplayer only. There is also a single player version available which replaces stormtroopers with Battle Droids. This can be downloaded from my site at http://www.btinternet.com/~browngreen/, or hopefully one of the big JKII sites =)

You may distribute this model file, provided this readme and the zbattledroid.pk3 file remain intact. Whenever possible I'd like to be notified if you're distributing this, but I don't mind. It may not be edited in any way or used for any purpose other than a user-made modification for Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast without asking me first. I have skin maps available to anyone who wishes to skin it.

The Prophet
