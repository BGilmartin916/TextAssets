Information:  		The AT-PT was originally developed by the Old Republic and was intended to be a major component of its ground forces. Platoons of troops were to be assigned AT-PTs; a single platoon would be granted the firepower of nearly a 
company of ground troops at a substantially reduce cost. AT-PT platoons were to be equivalent to light mechanized infantry units with the added benefit of speed and extended comlink ranges, thus permitting the platoon to patrol a far greater area.
This light walker was also intended to provide armoured heavy fire support to infantry units. A soldier strapped into this vehicle was turned into an one-man attack force capable of stopping a full squad of infantry. Although this walker cannot match 
the speeds obtainable by repulsorcraft, they can be devastating against conventional ground forces.

			Project designers of the AT-PT developed the light walker to be suitable for open ground, shallow water, jungle, mountain terrain, and urban locations. This design can overcome inclines and obstacles that block repulsorlift and 
treaded craft due to its independently adjusting leg suspension system. Unfortunately, most of the AT-PTs were carried onboard the famed Katana Fleet, and when that fleet disappeared without a trace momentum to continue the AT-PT project evapourated.
As a result the project was canceled.Ultimately, AT-PTs were never given the thorough battlefield testing they deserved. Many of the concepts pioneered by this design were later incorporated by Imperial engineers when they created the AT-AT and AT-ST.

			 Its heavily armoured command pod accords the driver with outstanding protection. Small flank hatches (with foot pegs below them) allow access into the cramped cockpit. Its legs can be fully extended upward for either high speed
movement or to allow the driver a superior observation position. The AT-PT can also adapt to operate in cramped conditions by moving itself into a "half crouch" posture, where its command pod is lowered to be even with its legs' drive joints. 
When compared to the AT-ST, the AT-PT's drive system affords the light walker with superior balance. When sealed, the vehicle is virtually immune to small-arms fire. Located behind the command pod is the walker's main drive unit. Its primitive sensor 
package is employed for navigation and assists in alerting the driver to approaching dangers."

    AT-PTs are seeing use by Imperial Forces and can be carried into battle by Sentinel-class Landing Shuttles. Unfortunately, the Rebels have obtained a few AT-PTs from the Empire. An example of this was seen on the planet of Fest, where Rebel commandos
stole three AT-PTs from a secret Imperial weapons research facility. These walkers can still be found in the ranks of mercenaries and pirates who stole them, bought them on the black market or salvaged them from battlefields. Planetary defence forces such
as the m'Yalfor'ac Order (from the planet of Guiteica) employ the AT-PT (they approximately maintain three dozen of these light walkers).

NOTES FROM THE AUTHORS:

This model has 1 year and i never thought that it would be finished but well, live is live and casually i contacted with NeoMarz1 and he was able to do this great skin for the model. Also i'll make soon a new version with much better walk animations,
if you get a veh file extension error, you have to many vehicles installed in your base folder, remove some of them from your base folder. standart max vehicles, then onces from raven included, is 16. there are mods that can improve that.


To install put it in your 'GameData/Base" folder, to uninstall remove "atpt.pk3" from your 'GameData/base' folder.

IMPORTANT:
THERE IS A .DLL INSIDE THE ZIP, EXTRACT IT TO YOUR /BASE FOLDER AND YOUR VEHILE LIMIT WILL BE INCREASED TO 64 OR SO.


HOW TO PLAY IN A MAP THAT HAS NOT PLACED THE VEHICLE BY DEFAULT 

to play the vehicles in game start a map in cheat mode, "devmap ffa3".
when the map is loaded, bring down the console and type in "/npc spawn vehicle atpt_vehicle", make a LOT of steps back and then the vehicle should be in front of you.
have fun!, hope this help mappers in siege maps.
