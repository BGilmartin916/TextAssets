Contact: 	        http://io.meskinaw.net/

Skins:			Monsoontide   	

Sounds:			Yes

Concept:  		A self-aware mobile missile-platform used exclusively by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, hailfire droids delivered surface-to-surface and surface-to-air strikes with their stacked banks of 30 rocket warheads. 
			Hailfires roll along on oversized hoop-like wheels. In between the bracketing axle arms is a small, central body equipped with a single photoreceptor. 
			When the InterGalactic Banking Clan pledged its forces to the Confederacy of Independent Systems (in a non-exclusive arrangement, of course), its hailfire droids were added to the immense Separatist battle droid army. (starwars.com/databank)

NOTES FROM THE AUTHORS:

This vehicle is for free use for everyone, map, mod or whatever! you got my permission. 
The Hailfire droid is made specialy for siege maps, it could add some great tactic depth if you use it as a selectable player class.

This vehicle has LOD support: 
	LOD 0 :	2357
	LOD 1 :	1560
	LOD 2 :	878

Note about the animation, the JA Quake engine is not made for supporting wheeled vehicles. this causes the backturn and wobeling of the wheels when stoping. i want this vehicle to work without a mod which perhaps could fix or at least make this less visible. so its easier to add into maps we have to take this drawback, ok?

* Installation * 

Place the "hailfire_droid06.pk3" files in this folder 
LucasArts\Star Wars JK III Jedi Academy\GameData\base

HOW TO PLAY IN A MAP THAT HAS NOT PLACED THE VEHICLE BY DEFAULT 

to play the vehicles in game start a map in cheat mode, "devmap ffa1".
when the map is loaded, bring down the console "§ + shift" and type in "/npc spawn vehicle hailfire_droid", then make some steps back and the vehicle should be in front of you.
have fun!
