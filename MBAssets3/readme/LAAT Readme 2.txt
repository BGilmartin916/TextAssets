Description :  Improved handling, authentic sounds and weapons for the republic gunship.


INfos:

After doing the clone wars republic gunship I found myself unhappy with the Gunships missels and lasers and the origional gunship ATST missels. This is an "update" for all gunship models I have found. This replaces the default weapons with a Machine gun as primary and Homing rockets as secondary, replaces the default sounds with authentic gunship sounds from the clone wars cartoon and improves a couple of aspects of the origional gunship handling. Also the gunship now can hold 9 passengers and has better sheilding.This is not a model or skin so you must have a gunship in your base already. This also should work with maps that have the gunship packed in with them. If you want to use this in a public server the server must also have it in thier base. This does not modifie any textures or any other aspect of the apperence(with the exception of the weapons).


Installation:

Place in /base folder. This is not a model or skin so you must have a gunship in your base already such as the following

Majin Revan's modified Gunship:

This does replace the origional gunship configs for Mars' origional and Majun Revan's reconfigure and my Clone wars gunship instances.



***Known Issues***
1) The Machine gun primary weapon's sound will cut out when firing at somethign within earshot like a wall or another ship. I don't know how to fix it but if anyone does I'd be happy to know how.


if you would like to use this mod for any private modification, map or vehicle, please email me at the adress above first.

Thanks and enjoy.
