Skins:			Monsoontide

Concept:  		Soaring at amazing speeds on reconnaissance and patrol duties, the Imperial speeder bike is a slim,
			single-person repulsorlift conveyance. The lightweight bike can attain speeds in excess of 500 kilometers per hour.
			A quartet of small directional steering vanes on twin outriggings afford the speeder its maneuverability.
			Imperial biker scouts use two shoulder-level handgrips to control elevation and direction; a pair of rocker-pivoted pedals controls acceleration. 
			Located just fore of the speeder's saddle is a panel of toggle switches and knobs that control communications and other vital systems.
			Slung beneath the speeder's frame is a single laser cannon.

NOTES FROM THE AUTHORS:

This is a vehicle model like the swoop bike. it can be either spawned by players in game or placed by a mapper in his map. the vehicle is designed for multiplyer.
If you want to use this vehicle in your new map, you are very welcome - BUT give us credit for the vehicle please!

The Default skin is by Monsoontide.

If you wish to re-skin the model, I've included a blank template to work from.

This vehicle will become part of the Open Jedi Project - so if you feel inclines to improve it look for it there.

The speeder bike is equipped with a small laser cannon.


KNOWN VEHICLE ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
The "bounding box" for the speeder bike does not appear properly in multi-player.
The rider's position is a result of the way Raven set up the rider animations. If you can make a new rider animation for this
vehicle, please feel free.
There are no aditional animations for the speeder bike - this is a limitation of the vehicle class.
You can only have 12 vehicles max. If you encounter an error, try removing some vehicles.

* Installation * 

Place the "speeder_bike_mst_10.pk3" files in this folder 
LucasArts\Star Wars JK III Jedi Academy\GameData\base 

To uninstall remove "speeder_bike_mst_10.pk3" from your 'base' folder.


HOW TO PLAY IN A MAP THAT HAS NOT PLACED THE VEHICLE BY DEFAULT 

to play the vehicles in a game, start a map in cheat mode, eg. "devmap mp/siege_desert",
when the map is loaded, bring down the console "~ + shift" and type in:
"/npc spawn vehicle speeder_bike_mst",
then you need to move away from the spawn point - the vehicle should then appear after a few seconds.
Have fun!

Thanks to:
Duncan_10158 without whom this model would just be sitting in my 3D app looking pretty!
