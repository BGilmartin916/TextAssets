Concept:  		The STAP (single trooper aerial platform) is a slim, agile craft sporting a pair of blaster cannons.
			STAPs are often deployed as support vehicles in conjunction with larger craft. 
			The design draws inspiration from similar civilian vehicles called airhooks.
			Trade Federation engineers refitted the design with greater performance and reliability. 
			High-voltage energy cells fuel the tiny craft's drive turbines, which afford the STAP impressive maneuverability. (starwars.com/databank)

HOW TO PLAY IN A MAP THAT HAS NOT PLACED THE VEHICLE BY DEFAULT 

to play the vehicles in a game, start a map in cheat mode, eg. "devmap mp/siege_desert",
when the map is loaded, bring down the console "~ + shift" and type in:
"/npc spawn vehicle stap_mst",
then the vehicle should appear in front of you after a few seconds.

Have fun!
