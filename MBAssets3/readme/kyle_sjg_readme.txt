File Name	: kyle_sjg
File Size	: 2.44 MB (2,561 KB)
Date Released	: 07-26-02

Description	: Based off of one of the many unused jedi costume concepts done for Episode I,  I originally intended this to be a simple replacement for the single player game.  But it works so well in multiplayer that I couldn't help but release it for everyone's use.

Comments	: The file contains two pk3's.  The first one(kyle_sjg) contains everything needed to play the multiplayer character, including team skins.  The second(kyle_sjg-sp) includes everything needed to replace Kyle for single player use, including the fpls & fpls2 skins. 

You will need both pk3's to make the skin work in SP. If you decide that you no longer wish to use this new version, you can simply remove the second pk3 from the base folder. The single player mode will revert to the original version, and the JSG skin will still be available in multi-player.
