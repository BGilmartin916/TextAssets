-DC-15A Blaster Rifle   (2)
-PLX-1 Rocket Launcher   (6)
-Explosive Rounds   (6)
-Thermal Detonators   (2)

Equipment:

Description:
This class has the needed skills to blow off the limbs of a droid at long range. Not one to be faulted on accuracy, the class can make use of the zoom-in function provided by the Rocket Launcher to home-in on targets.
All Clonetrooper Demolition Units have been issued with prototype explosives to test. It has been rumoured these explosives are inhumane, and so field testing has been engaged.
This unit cannot move freely, nor can it dodge shots. The Support ARC is the best class suited to assist this unit."
