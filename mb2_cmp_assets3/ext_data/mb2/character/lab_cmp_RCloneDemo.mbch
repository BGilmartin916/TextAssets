Clone troopers were identical, genetically-modified soldiers bred and trained to serve in the Republic's army during the conflict that came to be known as the Clone Wars.
The Merr-Sonn PLX was a powerful missile launcher that was in service almost from the beginning of the Clone Wars and continued to be used in different militaries well after the conclusion of that cataclysmic conflict."
