Details:

Advanced Recon Commandos, also known ARC troopers, were elite variants of clone troopers in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. They were among the most skilled soldiers in the galaxy; however, they were less numerous than other clones. This particular Arc Trooper is a unspecialized unit designated for general combat. They wear heavy armor and come equipped with more Advanced DC-15A Blaster Rifles. Their own personal skill also makes them more mobile than standard clone troopers, even with the heavier armor."
