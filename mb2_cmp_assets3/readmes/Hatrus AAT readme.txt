Description: The updated version of my previously released Trade Federation AAT hover tank. This version has
an interior cotpit to drive from. This is the beta version and uses the AT-TE weapons I made for psyk0sith's
AT-TE.

Notes: Reskined, Cotpit Added, other minor adjustments. Skin is from BattleFront SDK. SDK was released knowing
that someone might use the materials included. So this no Master Chief situation.

Comments: Hopfully in the next version the guns and turret will be moval able.

--------------------------

Installation: Put the .pk3 file in your base folder. 

Uninstallation: Take the .pk3s file out of your base folder.
