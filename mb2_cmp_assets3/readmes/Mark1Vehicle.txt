Description of Destruction: 


Mhmhmhmhm =_,= you fools though I never branched out into the sci-fi, DID YOU?! Yes, I had long ago since created this vehicle ever so long ago.  It was a simple project that I had hoped to complete, and to this day it is my true pride and joy.  While imperfect when I released it under the moniker of Epsalon to PCgamemods, it has long since been perfected, and now you may enjoy the darkness that I have long since enjoyed. Thank your foolish peers for posting that POTD that reminded me of having this file still in here. 



Bugs: Arachnids are more of my cup of tea, but the only insectile dysfunction I could locate was perhaps not really my fault.  My advice to you is to not get in the walking path of a Mark I.  Failure to heed this warning will produce lasting consequences >_> particularly a crushing of your spinal cord.

Comments: No, thank you, I've heard enough as it is.
