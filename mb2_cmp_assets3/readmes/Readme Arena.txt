This Arena update includes some minor FA and description changes as well as a complete overhaul of the icon system: All Classes now have updated moviebattles Icons.

Most of the jedi icons come from Moviebattles Base Icons for the Jedi Classes. The Padme, Jedi Knight, Sora Bolq, and Stass Icons were custom made by me. On the CIS side, the Deka icons come from the MB2 base icons, and the Generic SBD and the Heavy Armor SBD, as well as the Generic battle droids, and Dooku, are all icons from previous FAs. The C3PO battle droid icons, the Jango icon, and the heavy firepower SBD icon are all custom made by me. 

FA Changes:

- Generic Droidekas have 2 lives instead of 1
- Jango Westar Firing sound has been modified, I took the Audio from the correlia Redo westar sounds.
- All Classes with push 2 no longer have it, since it serves no pratical purpose
- Fixed an error concerning padme's E5 blaster 
- Mace Windu was supposed to have Rally for the knights and padawans in previous Versions, now it SHOULD be working.
- Most jedi have been given health boosts to help them against the onslaught of battle droids
- Description Fixes

Over all there weren't many FA changes made, I think the RC Arena solved most of the balance issues between
