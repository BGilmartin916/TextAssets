Changes:

1) IG88 has been Added as a class, he carries a wrist flamethrower,  100/25 HP with Mag plating and regenerating armor, duel pistols and an E-11 level 1, and 2 poison darts.

2) Rovas has been given a good speed boost so that enemies with guns cannot outrun him for long. He has 35 armor instead of 65 armor, BUT he has regenerating Armor, so that he can engage enemies in 'short bursts'

3) The Captain now has a level 3 clone rifle and 150 HP as opposed to having any armor. He is a tad slower, however. 

4) The Zabrak now has an even greater speed boost

5) Mercenary soldiers now have 50/15 armor with magnetic plating instead of 40/50 armor like they did before. 

6) Mercenary elites now have an a208 level 2

7) The Security Droid Mark III now has 80/55hp, Comparing the merc elite with the Mark III, the Merc is faster and has the advantage of the burst fire mode for his a208. However, the Mark III has 80/55 armor, slightly more than the merc, an Ee3 level 2 with a scope and relatively fast and constant rate of fire, as well as a flamethrower to boot. 

8) The Male Scientist now has dodge 2

In general these changes were made to smooth out some of the problems that the classes faced in this recent release. The OLD Raxus was extremely pro-smuggler, and the customs classes were constantly being slaughtered. In this recent release, the Customs had the advantage because I [And i admit this whole heartedly] nerfed the smugglers too much. I have now buffed the Smugglers and added an Extra Class. The question remains whether the customs are still strong enough to win against them. Normally i have a pretty good sense of whether an FA is balanced or not, but for this one I strongly recommend a large scale FA test with competition between two randomly chosen teams.
