Jasper Kasai
- For assisting with the testing
- For suggesting ideas

Rick
-For also being nice enough to test my map when by all rights, he didn't need to.

-For giving some suggestions of little details I could add.
-For giving the odd ideas when I needed them.

Ripley

Calexus
-For approving of the Dexerity Mandalorian (so I added it to the FA).

Big
-For randomly turning up and deciding to help with the testing anyway.
