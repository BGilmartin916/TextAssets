Remnant Briefing: Kyle Katarn is loose on this ship. We believe that Jan Ors has also been released, and officers have reported that a small rebel force has landed on board and infiltrated the Doomgiver.

Wipe the rebels out and ensure that they do not sabotage the Doomgiver.

-Galak Fyyar


New Republic Briefing: The flagship of Galak Fyyar's Fleet has left the Remnant installation containing a cargo of force-sensitive troops.

Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors are on the Doomgiver. Help them bring down the shield generator so that Rogue Squadron can destroy the ship.

-Luke Skywalker

The main objective in detail:
The New Republic have to walk a long way ( a really long way, actually ) to get to the generator. In a room close to the generator, there is a hackable panel that can be used to disable the forcefield around the generator, or alternatively the forcefield around the generator can be destroyed by blowing up all 4 source pipes in the generator room (after destroying the protective devices above them).

The New Republic then must shoot at the generator until they win.
