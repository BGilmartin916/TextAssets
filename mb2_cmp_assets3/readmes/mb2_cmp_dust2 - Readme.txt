Description		: Mission Briefing:

			Loyalists of the Republic have discovered Bounty Hunters trying to sell an ancient Sith weapon to the
			Seperatists on Tatooine. I am sending you to Mos Espa in order to destroy it. Use the detonation pack
			to destroy one of the weapon's parts at the designated target zones and it will be rendered useless.
			
			Due to the secrecy of this mission, we cannot send you Clonetrooper support. Instead, you will be 
			supported by the local loyalists.

			- Mace Windu



         
	  		  This map is a remake of the famous Counter-Strike map 'de_dust2' and the objectives are adapted
			  from it since it's one of the best map structures suitable for MB 2.
			  You can plant and defuse the bomb by pressing the 'use' key. 


KNOWN ISSUES:		  - Dropping the bomb: If the bomb was dropped by a player and lies on the ground for a certain
			    time, it will respawn at the Rebel startpoint. This is not very nice for the gameplay in my
			    opinion, but it's hardcoded and I'm not able to change that.
			  - Target zone: In JKA, the target zone is reduced to a single target point due to engine restrictions.
			  
			  - Defusing the bomb: When you successfully defused the bomb, it will remain on the ground in
			    contradiction to CS. Nevertheless, the countdown is stopped.
			  - Detonation: A detonating bomb does splash damage but this effect is bugged due to the JKA engine.
			    People that camp behind walls close to the bomb will not be damaged while others in open areas
			    further away can be killed. The 'earthquake' effect during the detonation has the same side-effect.
			 

Included		: - New textures, shaders and effects
			  - new Icarus scripts (bomb 'entity')
			  - new music


Instructions         		: The map is exclusively delivered together with the Movie Battles 2: CMP package.
			  The map will appear in your map list as "Assault on Mos Espa", in case the Movie Battles 2 mod is loaded.
			  You can start the map also with the aid of the console:
			  "/map mb2_cmp_dust2"
			  Please notice: The map does not contain any weapon respawns or usual spawnpoints since it is for Siege only.
