Oh! So you did decide to see what isn't interesting, like a readme parhaps?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Kashyyyk map which is based on the battlefront map (it has had DRASTIC changes since then) during the ESP 4-6 period (that means no clones, EP 3 lovers) when Han Solo and Chewbacca liberate Kashyyyk from the chains of the imperials.
This focused on when Han Solo and Chewbacca call for assistance from the Rebels by using a communication hub to send the message out to the rebel fleet, of course like most well laid plans it gets foiled in the end.
(Referance for this is Star Wars Galatic Battle Grounds, for any of you nerds out there).

This map has had a lot of help from people, mostly fellow mappers, but from friends and generally everybody who chipped in.

I give thanks to the efforts of:

Lindsey, for helping start me off on mapping.
---------------------------------------------
Tom, for helping me with the larger part of the mapping (a very large part!).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gabriel, for assisting me when the other two weren't present and sorting some big problems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ender, for assisting me with the music and getting me to move my arse and reminding me to ask for permission of models. Also, for fixing crashy models and dodgy sounds.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Saberfang, for getting me information and helped prevent me from making a big mistake with the traitorous wookiee.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shivan, for not only sorting the clipping problem but also sorting the sound problems with the models.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Someone, for doing a quick CMP loading screen for zombie horror. I found it quite funny actually.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The peeps who tested the FA classes, Jaap, Mindhunter, Ender, Valgar, Sneaky (he has his reward, Kashyyyk has the Arm of Sneaky), DacksZero, nanoo, iXin, someone, Shivan, Hauntry, Emiel Regis, Tom, Lindsey and anyone else who I missed out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also give credit to the people who didn't abuse IRC admin... you know who you are...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of course myself, for thinking up solutions to problems and 'spur-of-the-moment' fun stuff to add.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And various other people who helped in general, and if I missed you out, sorry.
