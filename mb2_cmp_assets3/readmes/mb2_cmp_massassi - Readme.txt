A map for the Jedi Academy mod-Movie Battles 2 (www.moviebattles.com) for the community map pack

Created by Gabriel

Description:
------------

After the destruction of the deathstar (ep. 4) a small imperial taskforce managed to land on Yavin 4. Rebels thought they'd be safe using an advanced shield technology. The only weakness was the generator itself could be disarmed by destroying 2 of the "arms" holding the generator "sphere".

Rebels:

A small imperial taskforce has managed to elude our defences. Defend the base at all costs!

 
----------------------------------------------------------------

Imperials:

Infiltrate the base and destroy the shield generator. Spies have allready set the charges, it is up to you to trigger them.
