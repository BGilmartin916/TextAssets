Map description         : Streets of Theed. Rebels must find a randomly spawned NPC in the city and press their use key on him to get "access codes". They must then make their way to the Security Center and hack the console upstairs to win.
				

Other info              : This map required so much updating/upgrading I think theres only 1 or 2 buildings left from the old version. :).

Additional Credits to   : Frost for some variation on new textures and advise on improvement, Liberty Ashford for her Sabe Model, Immenor for his shader advise, Tom for letting me use parts of DOTF's FA, the CMP testing team for their helpful feedback and =Someone= for his planned help but has sadly dissapeared :(

Thanks to               : Thx to the community for their patience these last 6 months :P
