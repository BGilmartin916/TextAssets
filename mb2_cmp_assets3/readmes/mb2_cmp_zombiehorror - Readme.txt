Credit to DarKDuDe for making a Zombie model/skin. I have to credit myself (Rusty) on the sounds however, as none were included and a Kyle Sounding Zombie isn't very scary. I would ask for permission, but there was no contact information. Failing that I would have also included a ReadMe for it, but there wasn't one in the download, so I'll just quote what was written for the description:

-------------------Zombie----------------------
-basics-
this is my 2nd skin, kinda ran out of ideas so i thought i would make a zombie skin lol.
basicly i just messed around with the rax model and made it look all evil n sith..
I started out trying to skin a doom³ monster but i never figured out how to remove the hair so i just painted the hair black.
To avoid getting flammed and ppl sayin "Hey you #%2in suck coz this dont look liek doom3 lololz" this skin is NOT supposed to be d3 just yet...
anyways yeah... ill make this into a full version if you guys like it, but for now its:
/model Zombie
-dark clothes
-dark shoes
-dark hair
-pale face
-gory stomach wound
-blood on hands from eating ppl n stuff
-default taunts
-no team colors

hope u like it >:O
