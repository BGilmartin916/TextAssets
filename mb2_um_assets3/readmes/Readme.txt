uM Bouncy

Map Name: um_bouncy
Original Concept: QE Team

With Help From: Rebel, Frenzy


uM Bouncy Bash
=========================================================================

Map Name: um_bouncybash
Original Concept: Frenzy
Map & FA Design: FlyingSpaghettiMonster
With Help From: DerFurst


Known Bugs
==========================================================================

It's possible to get stuck bouncing in one spot if you do something like a kick getup from knockdown.
Unfortunately this is an engine bug, so there's nothing I can do to fix it. A few things, like Roll Stabs, are 
disabled in FA because of this. Landing on something (or someone) is the only way to escape after getting stuck.


Special Thanks
==========================================================================

Rebel, for patiently describing how the original Bouncy worked so I could recreate it.

Frenzy, for thinking of so many improvements and coordinating most of the map testing.

The Elite Warriors clan for hosting the tests.

All of the people who helped with their feedback.


Credits
==========================================================================

The maker of the QE map BouncyBouncy who provided the inspiration for Bouncy Arena.

The music used in both maps is Frozen Wheel by Eleven Tigers, as recommended by Frenzy. 

Custom textures are mostly edits of base textures along with a few that are original.

FA character models on Bouncy Bash are from the Movie Game Mappack's Shogun.
