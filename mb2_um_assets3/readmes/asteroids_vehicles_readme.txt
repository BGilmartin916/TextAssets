	Modeled and skinned by:			Manquesa - parts of the mesh was originally by by somebody else.  Who, I don't know.  It was downloaded off a site which I don't remember the url but it came with no readme file and nothing on the site's page indicated who made it.  The cockpit section and front blasters as well as the struts that connect the nacelles to the rear vanes are of the original mesh, everything else was modeled by me (manquesa).  The original mesh was obviously modeled after the y-wing model found at http://www.scifi3d.com made by Al Meero, but I don't believe it to be the same.
