---Bespin Streets---

One dark and stormy night, Rebel sends a Steam message which ultimately lead to the porting of this classic map to Movie Battles II. The tale is too dark and fraught with peril to retell - not until we're all in our graves. You'll never make me talk!

Ninety-five percent of the playable map is directly ported from Jedi Outcast. Some texture assets missing from JKA are included for convenience. Anyone playing this is assumed to own a copy of Star Wars: Jedi Outcast in some format.
