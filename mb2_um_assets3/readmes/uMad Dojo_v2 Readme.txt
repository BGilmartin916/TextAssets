Original Forum Thread: https://community.moviebattles.org/threads/duel-map-dojo-v2.8085/

Created over 13 years after the original map, Dojo V1 was a decompiled version of mbu_saber_training_v2.
This was used in the now retired Movie Battles Universe (MBU) community for training and events.

Dojo V1 was ported by Frenz to modern MB2 albeit with some modifications and rooms removed for simplicity
to work with duel mode.

Version 2 is heavily inspired by the original work I did over a decade ago with the goal of everything
being easy to reach by both Jedi and Sith, minimising walking distances to rooms where possible.
