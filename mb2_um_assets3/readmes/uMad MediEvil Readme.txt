---------------------------
Medi Evil Battles

To install:
Place qEmedi-evilbattles-beta.pk3 in MBII folder.
-------------------------------------------------
The map involves two teams going against eachother with medi-evil style players and weapons. The land is to distinctive masses seperated by a middle water stream/river which is harmful when touched. 2 Bridges connect the two land masses aswell as other objects.
FA Classes:
Knight
Barbarian
Marksman
Rogue
Magician
Cleric

Knight
Strong Against: Magicians
Weak Against Barbarians
Use of High force block is a good defense against magicians. Slow attack power is weak when fighting Barbarians. Knights have a slight higher speed than Magicians to help catch them if they run.

Barbarian
Strong Against: Knights
Weak Against: Marksman
Use of APMultiplier/BPMultiplier and Dual weapons is good against Knights, but lack of force is bad when being shot at by Marksmen. Barbarians have a slight higher speed than Knights to help catch them if they run.

Marksman
Strong Against: Barbarians
Weak Against: Rogues
Strong force draining and damaging projectile is good against Barbarians, slow fire speed will be useless against fast Rogues.

Rogue
Strong Against: Marksman
Weak Against: Magicians
Swiftness is handy when taking out Marksmen, but Magicians will be able to see through the Rogue's cloak and take them out with high damage. The Rogue hides a poison dart and they will be able to eliminate enemies on low health with it.

Magician 
Strong Against: Rogues
Weak Against: Knights
Well aimed AoE force destruction attacks will prove useful against Rogues, but will not be able to penetrate Knight's high force block.

Cleric
Not designed to be Strong or Weak Against classes, but proves to be good support by providing healing to teammates. Although not high on attack powers, clerics can sense danger with MIRALUKA and escape with Mind Trick.
---------------------------------------------------------
Objectives:
The are two objectives for each team to complete. The Red Team (Defenders/Win on time) have a pedestal object in their castle which can be damaged by the Blue Team, if it is destroyed the Blue Team wins. The Red Team must either defend it on time, defeat the other team, or capture the Blue Team's 'Treasure'. The Blue Team's objective is to destroy the Red Team's pedestal, but they must also defend their 'Treasure'. If the Red Team takes the 'Treasure' (A blue crystal in the Blue Team's castle) and returns it to their pedestal, the Red Team win.
---------------------------------------------------------
Replacements for player models and weapons used on the map was extremely helpful by designers. Most replacements were downloaded from and can be found at www.jk3files.com
The creators of the used replacements are to be congratulated on their successive work.
---------------------------------------------------------
Medi Evil Battles is still in it's beta period, so there is much more work to be done to improve the map.
