---Pirate vs Ninja---
---Antioch---


Many hours, let alone 2 years have gone into this map. I hope that the community, as is, appreciates this map, as well as the rest of the uMad? map pack for what it is, and enjoys it as much as it was to make.
Thanks to Frenzy for making the levelshots and even getting me involved in this mappack in the first place. I also want to thank Aalya for making the basic layout of Antioch and allowing me to remodify the map to make
it Moviebattles appropriate.
