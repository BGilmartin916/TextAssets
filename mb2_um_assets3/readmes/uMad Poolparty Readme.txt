---Poolparty 2---

Inspired by Plasma's original Poolparty, this map expands on the idea
with a larger area well suited to a dozen or more players. Also, it's
under the ocean.

Unfortunately the original map makers never quite completed it (you 
might notice an inaccessible area under the pool if you look closely).
The map is still very playable and quite fun, so the team decided to 
release anyway.
