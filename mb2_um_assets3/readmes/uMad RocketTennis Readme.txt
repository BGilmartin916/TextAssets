---Rocket Tennis 2---

At the request of Frenzy, I was recruited into doing a remake of the classic Rocket Tennis for the uMad? map pack. The goal of the remake was to implement a scoring system and correct some of the original's flaws - such as being able to shoot your own team's target. My personal goal was to bring the visuals up to a respectable level.

One week long mapping marathon later and the map was done. Thanks to Frenzy for selecting the perfect music.

The V2 release brings some bug fixes and alterations to the FA for a better overall experience.
