---Sniper Lab Operative---

This map takes place in space with the Rebellion trying to destroy the
Imperial's space station Sniper Labs before it sends critical data.

The original version of the map was released back in B17. As of V1.01 some things
were broken due to age. The uMad version fixes those problems and adds a few upgrades 
like more realistic lighting, gameplay streamlining, and a new skybox. The map is
otherwise true to the original.
