---Swoop Battle---
---Ragnos Battle---

After creating Swoop Race, many testers commented that they'd like to see a map with swoops battling.
Initially I didn't really have any hazards in mind, this was just going to be a simple arena with a bunch of different swoop bikes.
After discovering that swoops could float on lava and going with a Korriban theme, I got the idea to use the ghost of Marka Ragnos
as the centerpiece. Then it became a test of how many ways I could think of to sadistically harass players.

Ragnos Battle is essentially the same map, sans swoops, and modified to better accomodate sith.

Lord Ragnos is wise!
