---Swoop Race---

This map is the answer to the question, "What do you get when you combine Jawa Race with Swoops?".

It's also probably the reason why uM V2 exists at all as a mappack. Frenzy had been pestering me about making a new uM map for ages,
so I finally gave in and started on this. Tests of the map helped spur a few other authors into activity with their own projects,
and it all kind of snowballed from there.
