---Throw Them In Redux---

Made in less than a day, this is a drastic graphical upgrade for the original QE throw them in.
Also fixes a quirk with damage taken while in the water. Thanks to Juggernut for the excellent
skybox/water blend work this is based on.

Original Concept: QE Team

Textures: Raven Software, Movie Battles II, Spaghetti, Juggernut
