---X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter---

Inspired by the game of the same name, this map is ported from the base map KotOR Flight School.
It's also scaled to 1/4 size in an attempt to reduce lag problems in vehicle maps. Each team
has a wide variety of ship classes intended for varying roles. Guides and gameplay tips
are provided throughout the FA class descriptions and the objective menu.
