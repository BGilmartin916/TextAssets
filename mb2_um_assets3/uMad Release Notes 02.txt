~~~~uMad Mappack 02~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~Release Notes/Comments~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 2 of the mappack follows the same lulz spirit of the
first release while bringing even more original content.

Of the eleven new maps, four are completely new to the game,
four are heavily modified base ports, two are updated CMP maps,
and one is an upgraded blast from the B17 past. There are
also updates for Medievil and Rocket Tennis from uMad 1.

It's been almost three and a half years since the last release.
In that time a lot has happened to MBII. Ups and downs throughout.
Regardless of what the future holds, I'm proud of the work we've done
here and hope the community enjoys playing uMad for a long time to come.

Bon appétit!

~~~~Release Notes/Comments~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Things to note about this mappack are that it is full of new, old, 
and remade material. Things that are fun to play and full of 'lulz'.

You'll see recycled maps such as zombie horror or super death arena. 
They were and have always been fun, but we updated them with more interesting,
more balanced and overall more fun material (specifically the FA).

We hope this release will get people to notice our 'lulzy' cause and inspire
many to join us in our attempt to bring more 'lulz' to the community.

From now on we'll be working on new maps, new concepts, and more custom
material. 

Enjoy...

uMad?
